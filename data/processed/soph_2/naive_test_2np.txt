those are the people that i grew up with and have known since birth
my cousins however do not teach their children about
the idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless

it is the parents job to regulate the readings of their children but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf

some people even go to school over the computer and get a degree in something

with the new year in offing christmas sets in high spirits for the festive mood

i believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight
magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people
i will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills how they give information to people and how they allow us to socialize
and i could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to
another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have

i think that computers are very helpful
a negative issue with having computers with internet certain websites that are not age able
that choice to look at that magazine read that book or listen to that song should be left up to them not made for them

dear computers have a positive impact on people
how about the capital of a state that visit slipped your mined
every person poses their own opinions on life

one reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise

books movies music and magazines
by writing the story the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort
i also find it interesting when people are very dramatic when trying to get there point across
over of the owns at least one computer in their house
dear local newspaper i also agree that computers have a positive effect on people
it deals with the science of information processing invoicing recording manipulating and retrieving information
if we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible
if computers are so great now just imagine what they will be like in or years
some believe that they help us learn but i just say so do books
so when asked we can show our age
furthermore there are too many advertisements on tv
in short censorship is a harmful practice that should never be used
a social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see
lastly who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports to stay active and have fun
in fact the are the best bet for a better future
dear that use computers is a good thing
this same thing applies with movies
everyday i would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball
what would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish
when all of these details combined along with language such as
basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive v was etched against the evening sky slowly facing into the distance
the abandoned building and there being no people could affect him emotionally
my last reason is because on a computer you pretty much look for anything
these encounters create an interesting meal

this gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive
once it is gone it will be forgotten
believing he was going to die the cyclist got back on his bike
i don believe it should work that way
those are just three reasons why you should not let people remove anything off of any shelves
these event would stay in her memory
in many cases the censorship of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy
using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand

as the day went on he felt the heat bearing down on him
then the girl went missing for about weeks
but with the help people are lively and happy including with friend
the story is about a runaway named and a runaway boy named
almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer
because of that there should be no restrictions in the public libraries and you should be able to get the books or movies you want
if you go to your local library and really look at what they sell or rent out you will then know what i am saying
then the item will be shipped to your door
i think that it is showing new beginning that she will have to go through the next year
does that make sense
for instance i was mortified hearing that the first time
all the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends
it also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house
they can teach us about things
turns out i was fine
there are movies that will have some sort of sexual reference a cigarette or a bad word in them
people can also learn new things
without books that are considered offensive we would not have any books to read at all
the mood that this author set was that of love and compassion and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him
bookish knowledge is theoretical
and with computers this is possible
in conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way
and if someone was allowed to censor things what would be included
dear local newspaper i am going to write to you about if i think computers are a good idea or not
most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow
there would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated
of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one
many believe that books should be taken out if they are not appropriate for all audiences
of the surveyed at the agree computers are helpful to us
it could of been making spread sheet designing logos editing someones or getting new clients
finally computers have established amazing entertainment for people of all ages
people spend to much time on computer
kids pick up some bad language from the books they read
these are the people that just sit on the computer all day
there are all kinds of books movies and even magazines out there
others should ruin the experience by marking the words out
also people of different religion could find it offensive
hard work is the key to success
there is a sofa set a dining table and a tv
being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to
as humans have become modernized with technology most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer
it you fail then try again
if they are exercising who if i am here on the computer
why would you look at something that offends you
some people get obese by doing this
when you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one because the salesman talks then into it
but it didn’t seem of many challenges to the man in front
dear a student i believe that computers have many bad effects on people
you might not know it hut all the communications in the world need a
she knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter she could survive living somewhere new
once my class was assigned to do a book project
the worst is probably watching bad things
the craftsmen were showing their skills
are some themes which can guide us to a noble path
you are allowed to express your opinion about it but taking it away cause you not like it is wrong to do
would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good
the lights of the nearby houses and of the bridge threw beams of silver in the river
in doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people
my friend was not happy
the staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do
but the teens and younger adults like that kind of music and enjoy listening to it
most of the books magazines and movies are all reachable by little children
they miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the or going out and playing in the snow and making forts or having a fight
i frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college
another example is when it says tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me
you can be on the computer and still listen to music
she is an expert in teaching
they are all offensive because they talk about bad stuff and doing bad stuff or talk about how they live their lives
they start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon
many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives
have you ever been to a library
they are great for communication learning and shopping
i am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people
that is how the cyclist is affected by his setting and despair is turned to hope
strikes and balls is your count
that is how the author sets the mood
in this memoir there are moods created by the author in the memoir
of will agree they spend at least hours a day on their computer
on the computer you can chat with people from anywhere
in books are censored
sometimes life can feel so cruel
scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school
however there is one plant that is similar the winter hibiscus
the hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother which symbolize happiness so she will be happier when things get better
i think all things should not be judged by assumption
my first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people
another opinion is that i think people should not spend most of there time on the computer
however that is life and there will always be something come up in your life that you should not witness or be apart of
when i was a little girl i remember going to the often with my mother to pick out books for school
no one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet
no matter what there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by
some people have family in another country
instead of sitting on the computer for an hour you could be getting your hour of exercise
if your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day one week can your vision from a to
the setting in rough road ahead do not exceed speed limit has a great effect on the main character in the story
my address was also posted because that message was a mobile upload
part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change
i believe that if we do take all of the stuff that involve offensive things off shelves then some people will be upset
so she is not being pressured into taking it
well you can shop online
it is a big deal if your cursing all the time but most kids know better and know not to do bad stuff
computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers
i think that this would be fair for everyone
i believe these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them
second have you ever asked your self about much time you ever spend with friends and family
i personally think that if people could do that they would but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you
we should be string enough to look away and not fight about it
one reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information
but any ways those are reasons why
take my friend she was online one day when a man started to talk to her
there were no computers this hand eye coordination could never developed
one person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive
you look at the screen type your words look at the screen again while clicking your mouse
of course this could effect a child in a negative way
i just think that people should write for the pure joy of it not to persuade people to do something bador give bad thoughts or ideas
there is some other things that are bad about computers too for example my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day
that situation could go both ways though
she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home lest she burst into tears again
computers also let people learn new things
this also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful
would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen
they can tell you anything
stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes
when i was younger i owned a computer
then more and more people get that book and other books that have this style of materials are being discovered and checked out
you have children you can lose the ability to watch them grow up to adults and can even push them away
he describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting
no is to judge what we see and hear
the outcome of that is success
so even taking away one book could make a kid learn one less thing
since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty
this is why she concluded the story with a vow
he should have packed an extra bottle of water
we all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies
spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight
reading using computers working at a table
after school kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing
also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject
course not and do you want to miss your flight for vacation
i felt like i was right their with her
another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online
they can be done only by the help of a computer
i at once rushed outside
which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test
all you need is a support from your family
next people begin to lose exercise
to me i think computers are a positive effect on people
the mood created by the author is the mood of appreciation for his house and parents
a recent study shows that out of families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time
dear i believe that computers do benefit society
they are getting to checkout books movies and music for free unless it becomes over due
on a computer you can learn about new places
dear local newspaper i just wanted to say that i do i agree with you that some people spend a lot of time on the computer
we should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for hours at a time
give people the choice
as the winter starts fading away and the heat begins to intensify people pack up their woolens
if people start to take those things away then what use would be for a library
they are not required to look at it so if they do not like it then they do not look at it
more than of most students in an average school have one
i traveled by train with my mother
how do we keep these sorts of material away from them
those who complain are only making more work for themselves
starting their lives over again and taking any job they could find
there will always be certain books that some of us find offensive
lack of good food good homes and poverty are some of them
i think that because of many reasons and i will tell you some of these reasons
you need a computer for projects
in this memoir the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood
if you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained you can go on or other sites and find any song you want to hear
it also helps prevent some kids to not smoke and do drugs if they hear or look at those things from experience
in this shows us that was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him
the tall trees silhouetted against the sky made a beautiful seens
the author created several different moods in this memoir
because some people like stuff other people find offensive
libraries also have some offensive items in them
people can think what they want to think about offensive material
teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games i know i do
little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff
no your just sitting there using the computer involves very little movement
the internet hold false information and can be a waste peoples time
they might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read but some people are more visual with the movie
but she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter
they you might be out of luck for what you are looking for
yes like the writer said the world is a fluid place
well before long one became two two became four and it just kept going up
people spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends
so she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed
when the burned the books we almost lost a whole civilizations culture and literature
these materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention
everyone has their own likes and dislikes not two peoples are the same
when you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house
when the author write and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding then i will take that test again it shows symbolism
and go on the computer
some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends
in my opinion it would be beneficial to students parents or teachers to get information on different topics
at most jobs you have to know how to work a computer
all you have to do is search it on your computer
and the people who read them books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves
i think computers work because it helps people with there own work
read on and i am sure you will agree
dear people these days rely too much on technology
he also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home not without memories your family and something or someone that you trust
geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter
in the beginning of the cyclists journey he is very happy and carefree
every library has different choices
the idea is simply unfair
give each person the choice and the rebellion will settle down
this would make her feel strong and focused
all you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy
people have come to rely too heavily on computers
on the other hand some people say that computers are bad
to the everyone has the freedom of speech and the freedom of press
allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library
a special birthday cake was ordered for me
just about any domain name on the web
dear the newspaper computers are great resources and are helpful in many ways
why would anyone waste their time reading it
humans especially children need exercise
is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture
to me she sounds like a brand new person
please help try and help us stop this
if children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad
we all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries
that is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college
identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common
to that back then they said it was devil music
you have to expect that from kids now a days
social networks only just make this even worse
although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day there not the only ones
furthermore not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist
kids love to go to the library to get books and just hang out with friends
he is feeling optimistic ready eager to follow advice of old men
the cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him so he follows their suggestions
this boy was jim who had been running away from master
you add a friend and you will tell you what has
a guest is a person to be honored and respected
i think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music
in that case libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves
finally society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person
books fill our minds with noble thoughts
how the setting has got on to him and he needs water badly
the advances in technology with computers benefits the society
when i was looking i saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians
now we have and others
in this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth
any one has the right to anything
they spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family
first the heat made the cyclist overheated
then the conditions become hot dreadful and maybe sticky
everyday when i come home from school i find myself going straight inside and to the computer from there i log into and
when the road starts to get bumpy and uneven it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster
there is no point in taking books off the shelves
again that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast
censorship is a very sensitive topic
also the students can use the computer as a way to study
would you want your six year old girl picking up an adult violence movie sexual content movies or even a with cursing in it
rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit
he hardly noticed the sun was beginning to beat down
being in that situation and setting i would have given up
you can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place
also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you
so as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people
for starters computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes
surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section
there would be so many conflicts if this happened
computers are very environmental friendly and so are people today
what is the first place you would go to talk to people online
i also thank that it is a good thing that kids are wanting to learn about what they want to do later in life
if you wanted to you could ask math questions as well such as what is the square root of pi and what is
throughout time fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive
obesity is a huge problem in five out of every ten are either overweight or obese
your well only get up and go to the bathroom and eat they will only do stuff that is in the house
months husband and wife got killed because of
books music movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways
but with advancing technology site gets easier and the gives more time other things
it we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have one of the most important devices
they can also go swimming play sports and go to a play ground
also another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is the rough road ahead he had to face
not all books are made for a particular age group or gender
most everyone has cellphone now and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places
if you have you will remember where you visited
they also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze you know the tough stuff
these choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood
when the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills the cyclists journey became exhaustingnever ending and difficult
everybody should be able to decide for themselves is right or wrong to watch read or hear
i as soon as i seen what i was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting
we can look up historical facts on the computer
because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments
when her mother says this she feels that she has let her mother down
lastly computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much
i specially grow in the coastal part
computers are really helpful
so lets start to cut our usage time down now
your spending too much time on the computer your mom and dad well out
parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing
also with so many computers it creates jobs
secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school
a teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender
books will take a few days and you only have days to research create and organize your project and data
to wrap it all up computers save us money everyday
class rooms in that floor
is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills
the significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the budding
people think that computers know everything but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer
read the following to know just how important computers really are
these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist
books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away
they need to be up and active
having libraries censor things would make people feel left out
if your worried about it take a break from it for a while
kids when they are little their brains are like sponges so they learn and remember stuff well at that age
she realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring
do i think materials such as books music movies and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive
he feels relaxed because he is at home with the water and the pine trees
i would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read
options and abilities to use
if you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a culture of some sort or something that you heard your computer can tell you
read on and i will explain why this is so important
the features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder
the television is a great gift of modern science
overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph
computers are one of the best technology invention yet to come that benefits society
another example say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold
a whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life his parents rarely did things for their own benefit
it has changed the way we do almost everything today
by the end of the story she has more confidence that she will succeed next time
he was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived
one last example was that he was lost
first i stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago i had a social studies research project
books and other works should not be censored in libraries
if you were lucky you could find a bit of what you were looking for
no one if forcing them to read them
the end when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically
also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy
children are more likely to read a book that they are interested in
the cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town
in addition computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly
do not even think about
it costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library
removing books magazines and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library
than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing
if music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books
to me in my eyes is just not right
she misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers
we should let the computers be in the
well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy
finally the author gives us a sense of culture
with the invention of and can talk to friends that move out of town
they were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf
the narration states i noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
some comedy and action movies are viewed as offensive or inappropriate to some people but many others enjoy the movie
she got shot by her husband
finally the computer is a great place to find information and enlighten yourself
computers are necessary in our community and we would be last without them
there are also educational purposes for computers
all magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is
this is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer
everyone deserves to read watch and listen to whatever they choose but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places
this quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed
the mood or feeling created in the story is mainly love
do you think that books music movies magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored
even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people the books or other items should be left on the shelves
the government does not want the society especially the youth of to read things that are deemed inappropriate
addition itself is a serious health issue
the author explains to us how peaceful and happy his home was
it is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents
computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways
not only does it save time and connect you to other people but it can help you physically
the innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery
like say you been planning a trip to for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it but your honeymoon is a month away
also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills
instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone you can chat online
libraries are a place where anyone can find books to read on any topic they choose
those children then start to ask other adults and children
people had different ideas about the shape of the earth
mother whenever plans a vacation looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it
they sacrifice their luxuries to provide food and education for us
the internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet
in the story rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist
sometimes the best thing to is get some fresh air and interact with others
people will always have something to do when they are bored there is plenty to learn and it keeps you organized
finally computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you
the present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same
last i am going to talk to you more about why and how you could
if they do not like the music novels movies etc
there are many things like books music movies magazines etc
did you have most of this stuff growing up
but they all did also agree on the fact that they really do not have the right to remove them from the shelves
computers give you extra knowledge you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise they do not they can actually help exercise
there is no more need to search for hours through biographies
you could keep in touch with old friends or family
the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail
also i used to be big as in overweight because i never went outside to exercise or in my own room
imagine what else could happen by staying of computers
i have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content
my second reason why is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away you can see them when ever you want
when the recess periods is over they get back to their classrooms to start their studies again
do computers society
the outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society
that is why will need technology
he or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable
the building is an abandoned grape juice factory which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in
the above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist
i listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
computers computers computers its all we hear about today
most people today neglect punctuality
therefore new exercises moves or tricks online can help them out a lot
most people think that computers are just new helpful technology but there is more to it than just that
if something is typed into results will pop up within seconds
for example when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones
a whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful
they give us so many such good things and yet expect nothing in return
from these reasons our lives because easy and convenient which is what people strive to accomplish
we can not talk to my family or friends
dear local newspaper i feel that the people using computers benefits our society
students achieve their goal of education and discipline in a hostel
only certain people can agree on something offensive
you walk in and take a piece
these machines get our messages and vices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds
using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time
if we removed books that offended even one person then no books would remain
all libraries have books for all readers no matter the age
in the kitchen celebrations childhood friends and family formed the backdrop to their life
although other things have affects on youth books are a different story
these setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride
if all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this
the censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next
as a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir
while growing up i had a friend who was very religious
so in my opinion computers do benefit society
if he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case
unfortunately trees are being cut indiscriminately
besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed
not very often or that i have ever seen do the authors make a book to just to put someone down
then came large rolling hills which created a challenge the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue
the webcam allows me to see me grandma
dear local newspaper name is and writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society
censorship was originally started during the in with the
three there is a better way to solve this problem
so the should think about what i am saying
this outrageous number of hours the vital the to exercise therefore allows their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children sleep eat computer
all of us have rights all of us have the same chance to express what we feel think or believe
when you use the computer for games or anything you do it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes to used on the screen
she longed for her natural home and familiarity
and friendship was shown as well the way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home
we needed it to thrive
the cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy
dad found out about and he decided to try it out
that is not a mothers dream to go and do that
books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years
he is talking about how he had such a good life in the house
censoring books magazines movies etc and what goes onto the shelves are mostly for enjoyment or informational
lastly computers can be very dangerous
so there is a lot of reasons why i think that people should remove certain book movies magazines or anything that involves offensive stuff
he mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story
i understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people
this is obvious shown it states in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding
in this book a young girl is raped very harshly
computers have technical problems that delete files
these are reason why computer could be a good devices
one example is because he said they where all family to them
clearly a life without computers is utter chaos
drew a park ranger says
he explains his parents doings
even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas
well i think the mood of the story is great
instead of drawing it the internet can save time and effort
parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much
the computer cant do for you
so instead of staying home all day i walked down to the library
in my letter going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society
if books and movies are so bad then why would they even have some here already
she will take the test again
these features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him
another one was to explore and go on a hike to see what is out there and just have a good time
computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions
the use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are
on my last birthday my father gifted me a toy plane
i think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in library
also everyone has different interests
in some countries dictators do allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases even watch television at all
when going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help
lastly all the people who their imagination off computers all those people who put that thoughts and feelings into the computer
censorship in libraries would take away from people some historical readings because of nude statues and the way they talked
she is very careful of our hygiene
a library is a place to go and find books music and other things
that book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past
people are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family
computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today
they seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity
they will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way
it would also keep people from loosing books
rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house
instead via internet
the main affect is the lack of water
we place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity
if somebody gets offensive about a censored material they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low
if you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies
his water supply is running how and he is dehydrated
if they are constantly listening to foul language and what not that is going to just stay into a persons mind
not just physical skills but computers help with research skills
i think if this does happen it will be hard to get over an stop using the computer
computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros
such as i think that if someone wants to check out an adult book they should be required to show id at desk
since he cant find water he has to conserve what he has
lastly you can even have fun relax and type out your papers for reports
one example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join
also the tone of which said said this showed hope she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass
we need books music movies and even magazines but we need them all together
sometimes it is just necessary
it makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that
my next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online
maybe a great song that made you happy or a movie that made you laugh
it could prevent you from spending time with family and friend and can even push them away
that does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though
the man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do
yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated movie
no one should be denied the chance to learn
almost everyone who has a gets a blast surfing the internet
will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children this scenario is how it should be
people could be in a dark room all day isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer
all these things make up peoples lives
his parents gave up their jobs and had to start their lives over entirely
then it was decorated
if you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve
many of them not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs alcohol and sex
that meaning was that you cannot punish the innocent because they have done nothing wrong
the government is trying to control us with censorship
the book is more then just that one part of smut
i read book almost on all subjects
the rest her family still lives in
first off i do like censorship laws to an extent
that other person might want to use the material but because of restrictions set by the first person the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited
everything he had trouble with he found directly on the computer
she is somewhat hard of hearing
now they are putting those same books in libraries
computers teach you hand eye coordination they give you the ability to learn about far away places and allow you to communicate with others online
i could hear the strong icy wind blowing outside
just remember to be careful
but little did i know she woke up and me watching this horror film called
computers are every where in a schools homes band business across a
remember when you would get to listen to your favorite bedtime story the
they can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble
this cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing
my final reason kids get tired from being on the computer for so long
sometimes people have sloppy handwriting
i believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves
computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues
if you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read
if you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section
exercising will keep you in shape and if you plan on playing sports you should jog a couple times of day
short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain
people will be amazed
dear computers have helped us in many ways
dear i believe that using computers has a benefit to the community
just that one picture shows your team name your last name and your number
you can do many things on it
so when i got home i went on my laptop and looked it up so i did and it said nothing about
just like the temperature problem the loss of determination could eventually make him lose consciousness
the school was full of boys and girls
in addition computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people
all those thing are some positive benefits people have computers
meaning shell survive also
i also have had a few bad reading experiences
dear newspaper people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives
the dusty dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author
computers are an excellent source of knowledge but that could be a problem
he took one look at the game saw the rating for it and said that i had to have an adult with me to purchase the game
you can get help in school work also
secondly too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others
people will always read no matter what
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home
parents like to protect their children from harms way and bring them up as fine citizens of
second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then
in conclusion the author created in mood through this memoir that family has many different meanings
computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world
the fact of the matter is if good stuff is out there then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too
do you know that a very high cause of obesity is
people need to interact with real people
the type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and mood
simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints
not in our population but the size of our people
also you can waist lots of energy to
people can also also contact other people
these are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship
many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos
a person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others
there is always a smile on his face
did you know people can loose weight by exercising
another feature of the setting is very old and dirty
gather your family and plan a trip
many people base their actions on their own views
if the setting were different this story would not have been as traumatic
the second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people
even as it is now parents try to hid such things from their children
i strongly believe computers are a waste of money and bring society down
in conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried
just how some of my friends said that they feel relaxed when they read a book
the library has a section for children only
every single book that is made today has a right to be read
no one should we withheld from a book due to age race gender or any other factor
every book has a different experience that can help a child learn
you could instant message them
one reason i support computers is because they help with writing
when you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything
although this information be in a local library
dear i strongly believe that computers are great
i was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age
when you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it
but it can easily get lost
and they do help people that have physical needs
the problem is is that each families limits and values are unique we cannot just assume anything about families in general
because i think she feels hope and faith
the computer is also a great device to use for learning
so i would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community
i found one that looked very interesting i got it and started to read it
my opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out
firstly students would chat their friends on the computer
she can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding
another major problem of computers is talking or chatting with strangers
this idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home
say you gotta old kid and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book
third and last interact with your family and friends
so in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral
during childhood every kid has many questions some their parents might not be able to answer
i strongly believe computers do benefit society
whether it or or whether its or all are a great way to communicate with people
i remember this one time when i was watching channel news and a years kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long
libraries should not have to remove books music movies magazines etc
and it was times better and free and better
firstly many people can talk long distance with family of friends
they never can do anything like going outside and doing sports
do not censor what libraries put out such as books music movies and magazines
for example you would not see me reading a scary book because it would just remind me of the movie and i would have nightmares
the books are arranged in almirahs
this is how the author creates the mood in the story
for example i help my sister with her multiplication on a math game we have
plus you can plan vacation to a place and be sure you will have enough money by checking the price online
he was the first author to do
they should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have
result is nothing but a big chaos
there are not for entertainment and things of that nature
when was a good smile run
evidently excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster even to adults so we need to stop it
join a team instead of playing on the computer and
these are the only ideas that i have that would work well
they are either black or green in colour
television is basically the same for movies
some of these ways are what some people are trying to get removed from our libraries and other places as well
almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it
nothing ask yourself that
moreover statistics show that of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day
so many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong
surely this effect could be very serious
the heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water
the most beautiful part of its body is the long tail
dear computers play a huge role in society
it does not bother you
however the issue changes completely when one considers children
parents should not let there kid go to the library without them if they are scared for them to do something or look at something bad
i could drop from a heatstroke he says
men in their sunday best and women and children in all colors of rainbow added to the dreamland atmosphere
the water was taken out of the man’s belly
businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as
you find a book that is immature to you but you do not have to read it
a place where people live and get shelter is a house there are two kinds of houses
when the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps he decided to check it out and see if there is any water
its up too the parents to assist their
for example the commercials for gum with that woman some people might consider that offensive
so watch what you put online there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted
last but not least would be
here are my reasons on the effect on computers
firstly the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports
i know their are people that will agree or disagree but what i think they should do is leave them
you can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before
if they have a right to remove anything from the shelves so does everyone
they help function machines
a recent study shows that of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks
it is really all up to the person they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice
call someone a fool we compare him to a donkey is not so foolish as we think
the cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey
they can bring people together
movies tell you what it is rated
this kept us active and enjoy the environment
have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years
those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people
computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job
if i do not like it then i just change the song
mail can so my where with enough yes but is free and gets there in less than a minutes where mail can lake weeks to go far
if a strict would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended
life would be very difficult without them
they travel places with people at their fingertips
people would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others
while i was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing
well i have good reasons as to why computers are good technology
our labs are well equipped
everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was
is always exceptions to whatever people say
once a kid owned a library card they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library
i think censorship is corrupting our society
the snake that he came upon must have been rather intimidating
our bodies need this
with the most common themes of sex drugs and money it seem offensive to some citizens but others just shrug it off as a normalcy
it help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of
obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being basically addicted to the computer
what did you use to search for this knowledge
there are even games for educational fun that many kids love
so i logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture language and much more
he had two tickets for the movie i wished to see
is the censorship in libraries really necessary
money can also contribute to the addiction
if you disagree with the book or whatever it be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it
after receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions
having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away
normally a phone would have to be glued to you ear but now you hands free
some material when reached to a specific town can cause an uproar that can shake an entire community
this is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults and children parents
after an hour she took us back to the bus and we all came back to the school
there are so many thing that you would be missing out on
so many people love to type on a keyboard as well but so many different papers that you type could be lost
this shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was
computers can help us with learning such as learning about or the population
young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful
the cyclist thought he was going to die
too much time on computer
the weather can always be found on time web for any in the world
also i could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says with any luck id hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat
i do not believe that people should be given the right to do that
i think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change
an example i have of is my baby sister
we have to ask our selves these questions
also in the story it states flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
i will admit i too use my computer quite a bit but at least i budget my time so i can also go outside and play a while
going on the computer can also be very addicting
i love computers but i as a teen know about managing your time on the computer
it has made it simpler to type reports
your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project
they could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry
they give her the christian name florence to remember her place of birth
being so happy made this such a warm home in
they say that they are censoring what i need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers
this was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself
whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it
however many find certain pieces to be offending in some way shape or form
i believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character
it shows the theme of the story really
the other day i showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention sense sliced bread
most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips
from experience with using the internet
i got up end did it too
lastly people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising
there is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line
in a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone
the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain
they help education by providing information about and for schools
instead of banning certain media one should label said media with a warning
so sometimes you have to treat them like an adult
after recess i get back to my class
being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the to write
i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face
if i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato i would but i never go on the computer unless it is for homework
finally computers help us get our news foster
loved them and they were happy spending time with each other
although there could be a way to compromise
at the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some
when the eight grade did reports their information
because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it
sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination
i read an article the other day about computer usage in
neptune is the farthest planet
is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends who are faraway
flat road was replaced by short rolling hills
in conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together
setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclists physical and mental state
instead they are inside on their computers
why do we build schools and take much trouble to examine children in what they have learned
computers stop us from exercising interacting with nature and being with our families
next computers help other people learn about faraway places
i think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life
i think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper
as he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty
why they wrote it that certain way
this leads to a downward spiral of our society
there were young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school
instead you can exercise
so knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the
i would be very upset if my child had to see that
now that older and like to read i read more books about action and mystery
my uncle has named him brownie
it is very hot as the cyclist is riding
the computer is like a cause and effect
the computer is a positive advance in society and everyone should be assured so
i also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too
the bigger kids like in grades should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before
one reason that i say this is because a computer is a big handy person in reality
in conclusion i think computers are helpful because you can learn play and talk to people
someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want
the books movies and other materials should be marked saying that they be found offensive
hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist
some of you might think computers have misleading information
computers are not a benefit to society
many people would be made mad if this did happen
the overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness struggle courage good outcome and beloved memories
his isolation while cycling down the shortcut was a definite factor in his strain
in conclusion the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness
it would allow people to learn about places all over the world
a lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine
plus you are not being forced to something you want to
but the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word
the author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head
so to wrap this all up nice and sweet
like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short rolling hills
businesses thrive in other countries
i went on about how my dad would not care if i bought this game
if they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh harsh thing
she still has hope of passing the drivers test
what do you think about it
its not only one person to decide that
those movies are rated for a reason
lastly computers provide games for your personal entertainment which helps kill boredom
also some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven
as humans they need contact with the outside world
in my opinion computers are good for people
firstly effects computers have on people are good because the people can learn hand eye coordination
it gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood
the help us in many other ways too
computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends
is grateful that he had the parents he did
for movies they tell you things like and other things like that
and very very happy that he did not just live in a house
its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon
history books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending
the author was clearly in a struggle against the desert heat
just like weather people always want to know breaking news
at the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect
in conclusion i remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when sick so that could cheer me up
for this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library
all you need to do is print out the pictures
saturn is the only planet which has rings around it
i think that society would be harder to control with this kind of media everywhere
i know plenty of people who type their feeling because they would never dare say them a loud
i get so frustrated that i hardly take bath or eat breakfast
and some of these people might be safer staying inside
directors try and cover them up but we know what they are trying to get across
computers have made our generation very intelligent
whether it be in books music movies magazines or anything else
it has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day
i have to do a lot of math problems for homework and i think it is much easier to use a calculator
the first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert
the author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then
the only problem is finding appropriate books that are both compelling and enthralling
books keep history alive
other people can find out about places they might go
later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents
so lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good
secondly internet access allows people to meet new people
no one could express love the way we do now
looking for an adventure of your own you drift down each section searching for the one suitable to your liking
paper no made from trees so must be cut down
i suppose you can infer how this turns out one game turns two and so on
you can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities
all of these features affected the cyclist in some way
that any person finds offensive
this gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence
if something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them
the water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more
she helps homeless teens find places to stay and she is always welcoming
the rider says the sun was beginning to beat down
with out any doubt there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds
having many different kinds of people sharing this material the libraries must try to have material to please everyone
from what the author says times at home financially have been tough but because they had such a loving family everything was alright
not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up
my second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people
in this generation more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation
people can use a webcam aim or email to communicate with other people
that is what has come down to computers
this might not even work but its worth a try
this is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling
every human being does not have the same taste in what they read listen to look at and watch
well a friend of mine used to go outside everyday went outside to play
with all the facts i have given you i hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe
without variety how is that possible
do you want to learn about the far away places without breaking the bank
for example a study at showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less
the mood of the memoir is warm happy and sweet thanks to the author
this gives you a chance to discover people with the same interest as you
people are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market
history books can be one of those that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in
more than that is kids
they can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school
but on this one i must say i agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people
also l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him
we should just keep them out of the libraries
why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples
i wanted to go near them
for example a student could have a project over
how do you take it when people come out with magazines movies or music that is extremely offensive to you
as you can see the internet is a valuable learning tool
to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed
though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school
next computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world
many types of people go to libraries looking for different things
lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen
one example of being offensive in a good way is the book
this makes life a lot simpler
when you read you learn when you watch a movie you learn even when you listen to music you can learn
censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read
we all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs we must prevent censorship and accept all
so i hope you take my opinion in consideration
before much technology people used to plant gardens and trees but now that thought hardly crosses our minds
instead of getting outside and enjoying nature they waste time on computers
this gives him hope and reassurance
for instance if people are on a lot of the time is research
i am a very talk person but i know how to talk on line if
this is going to be my first opinion
then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience
in the following i want to explain my opinion towards censorship in libraries
we should have an understanding of the bad things in life
they were all proud and happy with everyone coming together as a family
this also revolves around addiction
do activities keep you mind off things
so if you would please under stand we got to read all of our parents favorite child hood books
but when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information
the author creates a feel of happiness and gratefulness throughout the story
then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her
they even offered us tea
but that it is why these books are created for older people to read
you must go out and enjoy nature
one day i want to fly a big airplane
is thankful that he got the opportunity to grow up in such a great house and community
but you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body
soon we will become the leader of and we will get to the decisions around
kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up picture of themselves
some books in libraries offended some people
since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good
restrictions on renting that material could be set
there are ups and downs either way it goes
this is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries
this young girl once pure and simple now knew things no one at that age should know
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate
while at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended
world is far from perfect
some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home
they will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books
if you want information its just about typing some keys and a click of a button
lastly when kids miss their favorite shows one day they can just look it up the next day to get caught up
as the cyclist continues for a few more miles hes becoming slowly dehydrated and finally sees a building
you can buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer
we go to school by bus
you can learn many things online you can practice math reading and even writing
replied the book is to reviling
computers bring no adventures just pictures of them
everyone has the right to read and write what they want
there you have it computers use is not a major problem
just because some people take offense to certain things does not mean that everyone does
there are a number of windows in the post office
she believed that it was an inappropriate book for a ninth grader to read
the made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story
the mood in the story is thankful
but for you who do not get other stuff
no book should be taken off a shelf for its content
teenagers should be aloud to watch kid movies and teen movies
dear local newspaper i think that computers have a good effect on people
i like reading about anything and everything so i would love to read things and spark my attention
with all honesty books and novels were made for a reason
i believe that certain books movies music and magazines should be taken off the shelves to those who they are offending
the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out
if you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you
the computer is a major help
libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship
an example of this is the school i attend middle school
and they try to blame it on a book story or show they had seen
you be doing work or chatting with a friend but your also just sitting their
there are so many programs to use that making a big presentation could take minutes
you be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book
this is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him
these books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know
she was really sad she failed
it has a skin full of fur and a long tail
we are miles away from our friends and relatives
statistics show that more than of people on earth use search engine to find something on the computer
all in all the removal of offensive books magazines movies and songs is harmful to the public and to the libraries themselves
libraries should be able to have a variety of different books
computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society
heart disease is caused by obesity
there are better alternatives
you could find one quite easily if you tried
however there is a definite line that reaches over to offensiveness that can easily be crossed by authors across the globe
say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music
information can be found in any subject
computers have become a part our everyday life
i believe that if books magazines movies etc
they were to type quicker that they could before
the features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist
we went inside it was a giant library
book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed
believe it or not using a computers is unhealthy and not beneficial in more than one way
who in the world would say a computer is useless
the obstacle being a long cropping hill this made the cyclist exhausted as he uses much energy to summer the hell he was
it made it very difficult for him to finish his ride
is grateful for what they gave up so cold have a good life
the author is trying to be positive but its hard because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down
to simply write a book or a magazine or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong
many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read
they contain vitamins minerals and fibers which give us the energy to work
that to make a hopeful home
i was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful
every work would be remove because at least one person is offended every work of the sort
these people need to get their families and friends back
these are the main points from paragraphs and
if you say good for you
you can make audio calls to a person using the computer
computers can and will take away family and friend time
people learn from books books with happy endings and sad endings and gruesome endings are all able to provide lessons for the reader
people just really need to mind their own business and not worry about what other people find enjoyable
my final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social
people interact with people online if the want to
what is the world going to do
the cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place
many times i have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work
even if the others loved what they saw
this is very convenient
they might also have to have an adult with them
many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years or even days of sitting in front of their computer they become lazy
you can learn from the computer
for example the author wrote over one long crippling hill a building come into view
i personally can not stand rap music but my sister loves it
the child started dancing with the fairies
we can learn about the climate
my mother kept them carefully in my room
i actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials
computers can be good but not for everything in your life
no one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot day while emailing a friend
that is why i think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph
dear editor the source i have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers
censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools
you cant hide you kids for ever sooner or later they will find out about these problems
censorship is the underlying problem to many things
the paragraph tells how was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again
many people that do not have computers depend on the library
unplug yourself from your computer
people get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months
wrote a book by the name
it was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants flowers
this country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want
nobody wants something to go against them in anyway
the first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new
we come to know about their habits customs and traditions
this final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing
a good form of education is the exposure to different types of material
for example i a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations she became pregnant and it ruined her life
my first reason i think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places
there are some weak boys and girls in my class
then the kid would probably want to see the movie and they would not know what the movie is about
the internet is very addictive
in this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot
the faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals
they should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries
when you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon
there is a reason why things are and
not everyone will have the same opinion on matters that hold importance but that is why the goes around
you can see the foreshadowing
books could be a way people escape the real world
kids use the computer in order to do their history projects
i believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people
in the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist
this would eventually remove our freedom
it used to be that books were read to learn something new or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information
censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer
you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section
are all great shows for kids
they are great ways to help learning
a lot of the at home jobs today require computers and without the computers the job would not be getting done
the features of the setting in the story do not exceed posted speed limit affect the cyclist in the story in many ways
people need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever
like who won the election or who won the sports championship
keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn
i will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game come along
they start to eat too much and later they become very lazy
but my opinion on the magazines and movies could vary
dear local newspaper people spending time on the is a good way for people to connect with one each other
points are scored by throwing the ball into the basket fixed at each end of the court
each more mile he keeps telling himself if i can just get there ill be fine
that means that so many people need to resourced foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about it
has been working overseas for two years in
many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids
the author created a mood in the memoir
they found two boxes in the adjacent park
the author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt
do you think libraries should have the right to take books and movies off the shelves if they find it offensive
another handy program provided by all computer companies is
even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go i do believe that there should be some censoring up to a certain point
although the censorship of media through a library is only on a small scale but censorship is censorship
he learned a lot and we were all proud
big cabinets are kept all around the library
now as you can you see computers really can change your life
it makes him feel hopeful determined alone and completely exhausted
the library can be compared to a big computer
some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge or become naive because of this lack of knowledge
you do not know who could get their hands on that movie book or article
music will always be out there
dear of the i strongly believe that computers effect us in a positive way
so you can see why my family does not like computers
i would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things
if they wanted to have free time to go and read magazines they should do at home
obviously computers are beneficial
computers have none of that
you meet new people when you are in the computer
this is the major element that and him in the story
this technology can help you more than it can hurt you
we turned around and saw a little boy struggling in the pool
books are books and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf
this will cause the to melt and then the sea will rise
my creations are expressions that i give for world to enjoy and think about
this is my first reason
teenagers like myself do not eat for hours
children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to but sometimes we can not stop that
parents have to set a good example for kids
the heat because it drains your energy quick
i fully support the advances in technology
it is clear computers have a positive affect on people and society
kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it
they should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive
knowledge is all around us
they would get lost and not know how to read a map
the average day for children in is to go home and going on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home
positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand
my elder brother is a forest officer
the authors wording was very well done
censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction
computers is a positive affect for our country because it helps us find information for school and for location were to go
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness
no one can stop what is coming you just have to learn to live with it and move on
kids find these books movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books
movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive
the desert setting with its lack of water shelter and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life
if you want to know more about different cultures such as
traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him
a lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends
the last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains
home interesting was it
well if you think it is negative i am going to show you why it is actually very positive
he also encounters a terrain change from flat road to short rolling hills
its for your own good
music that you hear on the radio is filled with suggestive lyrics
so you make the choice
overall most kids in the have heard offensive language or graphic content
to quickly and simply get your news from around the world you can visit a website and lock at hundreds of stories at the click of a button
computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family
there are many electronics that effect people
computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity
we must show people just how bad the computer really is
in conclusion i believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet
she was embarrassed for weeks after it happened
which how internet can help you
a can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science
if people all liked the same things would not life be boring
but there is one problem
seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort
this language is damaging how kids read and write
it did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods
the winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged
lastly school was computers
the shows a beautiful picture of the you can almost feel the rain falling on you you really want to learn more about it
in my opinion this words help bring the mood to a happy calming feeling to the passage
this tells our children that it is okay to do these things when it is the exact opposite
other material could just be blatantly inappropriate for some to have access to
censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well
the answer is simple
also there is the question of what is offensive
nobody has the same views as everybody else each person is different in their own way
would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong
also when the time comes they going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and exercise
what there reading should have any effect on others unless they are reading also
as an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship
i can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things i have learned in school or wanted to learn
the authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read hear or watched by people that are interested in them
thank you and have a great day
it is clear the setting has affected the cyclist
my last reason is this technology can be a good way of protecting this country
he wears a simple life
i know that because i am driven to the world of computers
this is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children
it can also give kid information like weather updates that help to keep then safe
explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive
so the night before i did a bunch of research of different shops museums and places to eat
either its a law or the parents have made it a rule
it ruins their social lives and other bad things
we can see things we would be seeing we were present at the place but instead on a monitor in your home
the speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean
one could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again
the child obtains a book that is about violence and sex
in this he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love
a library a citadel of knowledge should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey
that pop music would make the kid happy
in the adult section they have adult books
the journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one
as time passed professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business
why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures
to remove or not to remove should people be able to remove books that are offensive
so they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to
many people use this method for jobs
try to direct them over to their age level area and try to find them a book movie etc they be interested in
the heat made his dehydration situation much worse
so what would you do if put in this situation
for example i think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination
to me the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a family problem than a social problem
tons of students in have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information
the man continues his quest to know more about the planets
he should attend school regularly
most of these victims do not return or are found
this means that the parents will have a much harder time finding jobs in and they might not get the pay they deserve
an example is i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state
most importantly computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you
there was no mishap on the way
was blessed that he had his house
the amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years
this supports the mood of the memoir because the author is grateful to his parents for teaching him what a home really is
obesity is a rising issue in and kids need to exercise
today thought the number of collectors is somewhat lees
after a few years had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father
so if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it
the strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect
i somewhat agree with her however i do believe there should be rules on where books are located
if students never know how will they live
they should not be banned though they should only be moved
taking books off shelves are like telling people to stop reading
the towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns and are no help to the author
these items be offensive to some people and they be too inappropriate for children
the cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain
also a lot of people are using the for there businesses
people under should also be restrained from looking through these materials
the opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across
so what is your side on this argument
they might see a naked picture of someone in a magazine and not like it
computers can be useful and have some benefits on the other hand they are harmful and they should not be used as often
but on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer
its all apart of life
all libraries are broken down in sections
do not read the book or magazine
there were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious
or your daughter from looking at porn
but if there is something that you do not like just keep going
the cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of
what would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you
the story of is just one example of censorship
computers can most certainly improve our society
the cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused
it takes away your time that you can be going to the going to stores restaurant the things you
there is no doubt that every child sitting here loves and respects their father and mother
another reason kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades
such as family friends or a group of close people
the creators of their work are most likely proud of what they have accomplished and would like their audience to enjoy it to
everybody around has a unique part about themselves and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have
i wish they would not but they feel the need to take things off the shelves if so
good marks give fruit in the future
my first reason why i think using computers is good because people learn more on the internet you know what people say you learn something new everyday
from the very beginning the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space
because of this even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing
now lets talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users
so when it spring again and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test again because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundings
maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf
all of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel
this is due to censorship
computers give education stand information to everyone
therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist
so then i decided the next time i have a project to do it on the internet
also because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high
if a family wanted to take a vacation they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there
other like word help you set up writing essays and stories
your personality also change with your social life and routine
the winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through
people deserve to have better and not offensive books
we need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe
they stand for these values but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do
this also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship the mood that the author set during the story was love
parents stress all the time about where their kids are what they are doing who they are with and so on
i hope everyone has an eye out for these kind of things
such as staying organized studies and even entertainment
dear in the the world has changed so much for the better
not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer
i have seen many of my friends get lost in these books and magazines right in front of a adult like there mothers
once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer
the last thing you can do is become more healthy
the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our one being
it shows that she is persistent determined and strong willed
these advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives
very hot the water was also degrees
my second reason is that advance in tech
your health is at stake
but shell be a different person also
in the class very few student were attentive
should there be censorship in libraries
therefore no book should be censored no matter how inappropriate the material is
it can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct
dear newspaper editor i think computer are a benefit to everyone
what will we begin to predict for the future
such as taking a walk and enjoying nature
this is why the mood of the story is happy
i think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things
flowers were blooming
weather places the will to continue all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist
why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen
take abortion into perspective
one man stood in front of a tank resisting to move showing courage and wanting a democracy
my school has a big library
parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve
for other people though the story is much different
the parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions
everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out or it
this is one way computers benefit all of society
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library
people need to enjoy nature and spend time with family and friends
but then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers
computers have a negative effect on people
they then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang
her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing until you thought about it a little more deeply
the setting he was in made him a little more wise
i believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things
for example think about google earth it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world
strategy come in handy surely you now see that some games are very educational
prefers not to know where her meat came from
this is simply a result of bad censorship
every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with
with these people can learn about other peoples opinions or spend time playing games
you can easily find the details and information you need
there are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends
they provide us with valuable research entertainment and cold hard facts
since all they talk about in the media is sex sex articles would probably be in the magazines
he not only makes local calls but also trunk calls and does not think necessary to pay for them
without a doubt people should still use computers are helpful in many ways
then they are right back in a chair making minimal movements
computer usage will keep you in the
a poll even says that of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer
now due to the wide variety of computer selection a computer is affordable starting at prices as low as sixty dollars
a second productive task can help us with is learning
the schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force
not literally but it feels that way at the time which is what you should feel
even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer
but i would have to disagree i think those books deserve to be read
the features affect the cyclist in a big way
the mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author
it is also a great learning technique for research
what do you prefer having computers or no
your family can make parties
jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face
everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want
so once the clock turned to i put her to sleep
should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive
we as a society do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released
parents can censor what their kids read if they want
keep the books that are on library shelves now for many generations to come and enjoy for themselves
this shows the effect the exposure to heat had on cyclist
this is second reason
also you can socialize as well as study with this device
he is running out of water but has the determination to get to last the terrain affects him
this shows how much she misses home
that there means that there is no way to from it
censorship for those who understand is unacceptable although select items should be viewed under supervision
also online you can watch movies and listen to music
this would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot
it goes along with me in the morning
lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet
setting does a lot to influence stories so it is important to keep that in mind when reading
over vast changes of terrain
therefore i say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy grateful
she want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories
people can make there own decision of what they want to listen watch or read
when you grow up you learn to read about the movie and look at the rating
everyone is going to be offended some point in their life
so what do you think
now he is a fashion designer

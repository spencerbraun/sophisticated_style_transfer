the <caps> for example .
then what we will be able to read or listen too
this test represents the achievement of adaptation to her new life .
too many lives are effect by <caps> media and literature .
what is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that persons point of view .
and thats <caps> scares me most .
<caps> had fun running and splashing with us in the water .
the people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes .
its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive .
we should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed .
the large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers .
those are some that nobody should even produce .
computers also help with instructions on how to make things .
i realized that my children will be telling bad jokes .
i went into the class and she was absent so i was a loner that period .
this would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place .
some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends .
i would hope you read and reread this letter and consider about believing that computers have a positive effect on people .
we watched the movie and afterwards we went to go get some food .
it sounds like an awful experience .
and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends .
those are the reasons i thought the mood set by the author was happiness .
when you meet a new person you often see those individuals have at least one thing in common .
then handed me a pair of shorts and we went <caps> our way .
some parents do not want their child to hearing or saying things like that .
flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used .
it also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted .
sometimes life can feel so cruel .
that would be on the parents plate to deal with .
and you will have no friends .
no water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going <caps> water .
all of us really bonded that three day camping trip <caps> and joking and just being boys .
it <caps> helps people write better and better .
we always have a really good time with it too .
the friend had the nights were they stayed at a relatives or friends lived mostly setup .
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
another example of the setting is when the terrain changed .
i for example have learned so much from .
a magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it .
you use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing .
they are more of a benefit than a burden .
<caps> ate a couple of fish and slept .
money <month> be the most vital thing in our society right now .
this would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building .
it is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next .
<caps> was silent because they were getting irritable .
i knew i was going to have to be patient .
removing anything from the shelf is not bad .
we were around <num> years old and in <num> through <num> grade .
students use it for studying and making projects look better .
when people are on computers all day they have less time exercising .
she apologized for the wait .
this would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the empire state building .
it made me sad to hear an innocent little <location> talking about things that are way over his head .
risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is .
movies and books can easily be censored .
the sad truth is that it never happened .
the mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love .
s he would not be who he is now in days .
my father died when i was thirteen and since then i had stubbornly resented each new man my mother attempted to bring into my life .
i could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still .
her parents would never let her read the <organization> books by <person> .
the mood he has set is love and kindness .
try and change what the reader might think about that time .
our pigs turned out to be great dogs .
directions are very important .
after i went to church i took pictures with my family and then went to <caps> to take pictures at the <organization> building .
i got half of the stuff i wanted and the other half was house hold things .
<caps> rooms are the main why .
also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family .
i met <person> in the sixth grade <caps> class .
it started to rain and of course it was on outdoor concert .
the cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town .
then <caps> started getting late and i had to get home .
this test meant more to then she just failing .
i was with my mom and my sister <location> .
they <month> also have music that has explicit lyrics on the <caps> .
as the fire burns it will go on a rampage throughout the the body .
this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
one kid was so tired he blow the plans off that he made with his friends .
they gave up everything they had for her .
in my opinion people would be better off without them .
i knew she would hate this book .
there are people that think there kids seeing bad things will make them want to do it .
the libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers .
<caps> of her daughter .
and that was the time i was patient .
the feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
we went to the funeral that <date> and when it was all done i sat in <caps> room and only could remember all the laughs we shared .
finally they came out .
<caps> whole life was being flushed down the toilet .
my coach <person> started to talk to everyone that was new to <caps> <caps> .
it is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research .
there was a girl name <person> .
the first reason is wind speeds .
when we got in there it was at least <num> to <num> people it parked .
there come a point when things just become too much .
they were arguing about something .
these are all great uses for computers .
my third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising .
the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
i had what i like to call a <person> who in actuality in my biological father .
at the end of class <caps> gets graded and the grade on <caps> turns out to be a <caps> .
this states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the empire state building .
you could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat .
i try to teach him things every day and when i go over it like <num> times i get kind a mad .
it was unsafe because the dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable .
com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate .
i suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through <caps> body .
the winds also would make just getting to the empire a hazardous job .
i have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer .
family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family .
no one has glued their fingers to it .
this is because she types and researches information all day long .
i arrived in town <caps> be very disappointing .
some <caps> even give computers to kids so they can use it to study .
all of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his <caps> .
so with the computer computer .
then take a nice walk or stroll in the park .
music is a whole story its self .
when we started to move i got a little happier but still impatient .
i was cold so he offered me a blankets i got him last <caps> .
one <organization> the only ways she can contact her father is through <organization> .
thats understandable but everyone else should not be exempt .
so i decided to stop .
he wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless .
the second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework .
one obstacle was nature .
a lots of uneducated children that stay home or do drugs in the street .
so computer have chipped into that .
but my mom said patience will pay off .
computers should be known as our friends .
one of them was air ships flying too low over urban areas is illegal .
i was okay with it though because thats better than nothing .
he is such a downer and no one ever wants to be around him .
besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly .
one of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not .
another example would be slavery .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents .
a phone call would come very soon but she had to have patients .
many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and i think that is bad .
<caps> offered me a <date> job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work .
they were both supposed be killed and thrown in the ditch .
patience is a good quality .
you also have a lot of fun said <location> .
a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers .
without advances in technology we <month> have a better and safer earth generations to come .
he would always tell me even if she was real it was impossible for a girl to be like that .
you know <person> says that over <percent> of people will never go in nature <caps> they get a computer .
makes them feel just maybe not much but better than they were feeling .
in a different area of the library .
the former quote was found in paragraph <num> described the pride and gratefulness of the home in which the author lived .
a final obstacle was an already existing law .
personally i love cats more than dogs but <caps> will always be the first .
you can have conversations with all your friends and family .
i believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library
then after the show seeing all the people walk out with big smiles on there faces it was a night i will never forget that night .
learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation .
the hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination .
the next mourning mom woke us up and asked if we want eggs and bacon and we said yes .
another way i was patient was when my mom and i went to go get my new shoes from <organization> .
my sister wanted a curling machine she got that to .
no worries the person no contact you by a simple email .
the author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country .
the constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character .
thats all that <caps> mother had .
at the same time i believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something .
everyone started laughing again .
the features of the setting affected the cyclist .
so does everyone else .
thats when our day started to be a bit better .
no material should ever be removed from a public library based on censorship .
but when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends .
<caps> that is a time that i had a good laugh with more <caps> just one person .
overall patience is every where and you use patience in a lot of different things in life .
reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways .
i suppose we were more tired then we thought .
being on the computer too much can harm your brain also .
these were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people .
then they say about <num> cars .
after i got changed i got a big chest that my dad could fit inside it .
i think it is all the persons decision to be on the computer as long as they want .
<caps> cousin lives in <location> and the only way i can ever talk to him is through a computer .
either way you could still find something about the writing to be offensive .
kids should no the limit .
it was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs .
i talk to my friends everyday on the <caps> .
they changed the way people think and how they look at the world .
<person> <caps> for example in the book <caps> its offensive to gays and one gets killed .
another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
he creates this <caps> by telling the <caps> about how his family took everybody in .
if i could cheer her up <num> id be happy to do so .
also with increased computer time people are not getting outside .
<person> is very grateful throughout the memoir .
this poses a large problem for parents .
i believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves .
the choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child .
another reason is that you can get a lot of information from the computer <caps> are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions .
the mood i think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness .
i was about <num> years old .
i have to wait to go to my aunts .
they will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
new <caps> is currently thinking about taking away computers in our town .
i bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job .
or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones .
alcohol is the same way .
this is one way computers benefit all of society .
it takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing .
and when he arrive at the bait shop .
<person> was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in <location> hands slipped and landed smack on <organization> face .
me than an hour to get there .
every time we think about <caps> we all start laughing <person> making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag .
she yelled out loud go old man the old man went and she flowed him to the store and she asked what was that and <person> sales that was nothing .
thankfully i had my <caps> so i watched a few cartoons and listened to music .
the listeners which are people that would rather have something read to them instead of trying to read it themselves .
they need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world .
my final discussion is music .
it should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group <month> be facing .
unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose .
<percent> of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator .
the very heart of which was the kitchen .
he read five books and only got a half <organization> a page <organization> notes for his assignment .
the only true story that i can remember that involves laughter was about <num> years ago at the beach .
my first thought was that they just got chicken <person> maybe wanted to freak out <person> <person> i .
also it would not matter to me if i walked or drove or rode my bike to the library .
this is the moods created by the author in the memoir .
when were together there is no stopping us .
she started pulling her hair as i stared blankly at her .
but the bad thing was that <person> was still in love with <person> .
the workers ran into large problems with the safety of docking over a large city .
when asked <percent> of <num> graders say they use e-books at least twice a week .
another reason why it would not work was violent air currents .
if the balloon wont stay still while unloading it is very unsafe .
that brings us to what happens around <caps> family .
the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
so after <num> months of dating i met the folks .
he said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done .
the setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist .
not all people feel the same way .
as we started moving forward the planes wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off .
some of the reasons i think this is because like in paragraph <num> .
patient is an important <caps> of your life .
some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive .
a time when i was patient was when i was at school .
the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation .
also there are many scams and cons out there on the <caps> .
just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive
thank you for your time .
who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think .
the fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend .
the <caps> <caps> family risked everything to help other families .
she actually thought i was attractive .
the parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading .
even though we were suppose to go
all they could share with me at the time was that she was being rushed to the hospital .
these obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come .
these are the reason <caps> i think computers have a bad effect on people .
its just wrong having stuff like that that can offend a lot of people .
it could be anyone .
the hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in <location> .
then i realize i need someone to go with me .
and to think that this event happened all because of the three main causes of laughter .
we realized just how stupid wed been acting and for the first time we were laughing together not at each other .
little did i know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner .
he said flat road was replaced by short rolling hills .
<caps> we are home .
there are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things .
these are the reasons why i think using computers is a good thing .
someone can only take so much and then when they reach that point nothing turns out any good .
i say this because instead of going outside .
we need to the of social without computer .
when she wakes up in the morning to take us to school she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains .
video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game .
information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life .
we had to wait for a hour before he came back out of the market .
they would not let me listen to the music i liked .
the mast on the empire state building had too many problems for the <caps> to solve .
computers also do the same thing for music .
many times have i been in an awkward position that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort .
<caps> grandma let us go intro the store to buy drinks for that trip .
you can share you want with people you barely see .
in this article i am given information about this main characters life and his caring parents .
there were many obstacles that the <caps> of the empire state building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the empire state building .
i believe this because every year new and exciting <caps> and websites are created and make life easier .
do not even think about
sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience .
libraries have sections for all ages .
i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason led us to a week full of laughter and true happiness .
i still got my game .
the <caps> loves his parents because of their sacrifice and love .
many people are very stern about there thoughts when they believe in something very strongly .
i was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible .
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation .
it is your choice to not listen to it .
i collected the eggs .
all relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile .
<caps> a mother of the <organization> .
i think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs .
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us .
thank you for being patient .
i also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir .
his parents always kept there arms and doors open for people to get back on there feet
such as a homework question or just to talk for fun .
because without <caps> there would be no happiness or joy in the world .
and its something that would have to be done .
these things are the reasons computers are good .
he says in the memoir that he is eternally grateful and still has a love of cooking .
i thought of what the words i needed to say to <person> but i was confuse .
this causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
she hated the dentist .
jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that i might possibly have for the rest of my life .
people depend on them a lot but same people disagree .
only <person> could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at <caps> .
i do believe however the reason why every book should be in a library is because all of them are different .
that night after dinner i found that i wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make <caps> come faster .
it has a playful tone with a warm and loving mood .
the people wont like it and they might not want to check it out again or they wont check nothing out .
my parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and i felt so tired .
we laughed and made jokes on how tiny i am as well as how much fun it was after i felt a little better .
i could be in the worst of moods and <caps> always knows how to put a smile on my face .
all sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore
realizing whatever was happening was not as bad as i had thought .
then fight for more books like those and then they would need censorships in libraries .
i learned that when you really want something or really want to do something the more patient you are the faster it will come .
from my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline .
she was going to make a blanket .
airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas .
say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people .
an obvious one is love .
to spend too much time on their computers .
spring is the sign of life and birth or renewal .
people everywhere learn from books .
i race <person> to the <organization> .
now you can use this technology as a tool not a game .
no one stops and thinks about someone else or their family .
i will never forget how my parents turned this house into a home .
starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building .
they are now a important and useful part of jobs people have now .
spending time with your family is something precious .
here comes <caps> walking up the front door which just happened to be where grandma and i were standing .
when students go on the computer they can chat with friends .
i found that book to be very offensive just because i was looking at it from a modern perspective .
my mother and father came to this country with such courage .
we did exactly that we tried and we won that second set .
the author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength .
i think that if they do that they might just take some <caps> .
i am so patient i can wait a month just before i go to cedar point .
that is some of the things that can affect the cyclist .
it is so much easier to do that then look for books that has all the facts you need .
but continued to move on .
he wasted <num> days waiting while i focused on school .
but what i respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor .
i walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway .
one of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible .
they laughed at <person> because she was crying .
lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is .
probably not on any teams or in any clubs .
over the <date> i had gone to my <caps> .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
some authors <month> do this in a very offensive manner .
then we gathered our things and walked to the game .
the curtains rose and the assembly began .
at the end when the setting is bright so is his mood .
also we laugh at funny things we do .
but the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire state building .
<caps> laughing did have an effect on <caps> mood and attitude .
it is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence .
the tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book .
so there you got my opinion that censorship should be allowed at high schools
they were stuck a half mile away from the surface .
i think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to .
the word has greatly changed .
the final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the authors parents .
there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
you can tell by the way she knew what her gift was .
the sign should say what content it has so the people can stay away from the room .
the night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure .
to me she sounds like a brand new person .
computers could even be used for school work .
it seems as if inappropriate materials are found everywhere in todays world .
though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages .
soon enough i found out the doors where locked i was <caps> mad and devastated .
the next most important thing is that kids and adults wont have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them .
these are the moods the memoir created .
also you cant understand what there saying half the time .
laughs and smiles bounded my world into <organization> and into the world of a few <caps> rednecks .
spending too much time on the computer is not healthy .
you never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you .
this has become a problem .
the most common thing that people do is laugh .
this is an example of hand-eye coordination .
in paragraph <num> the author states the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
all the information you could need .
says a local mother as she talks about a computer game .
then on <date> my uncle came over for my family reunion .
then in school i have to wait threw out the year and patient so the year can be over .
i understand that <caps> are wanting to read about famous <caps> and whats new with them .
but when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my <caps> baby sister was so beautiful .
when i have an essay to do i always use the computer first .
most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety .
we sent the guitar <caps> for a new one about <date> i got another guitar a so i though opened it up .
one day he says to me because of i want to work with computers .
everything would be off the shelf if we were to pull offensive materials off the shelf .
<caps> i sat up straight and looked at him .
<num> out of <num> <caps> use the computer daily .
i also love video games .
the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame .
love is shown in this excerpt <caps> how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about then .
another way that computers help todays society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic .
nature was also an obstacle that builders <caps> .
another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law .
this is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test .
last <date> my friend on a business trip the was for <num> weeks she missed him a lot <caps> mom let <caps> she was able to would have a telephone call .
to be part of something so special was an honor .
another reason was because of the winds .
someones health is very important now .
all of these <caps> can us research projects many other <caps> .
so we emailed our ideas and thoughts and were able to get the project done .
the winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building .
not only is <caps> fun but <caps> is also a very healthy thing to do .
i do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech .
they were to type <percent> quicker that they could before .
<caps> because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel .
toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water .
i asked why he was doing that and i thought their response was hilarious .
they say that they are censoring what i need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers .
during the <date> dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future .
is not offensive the whole way through .
this is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers .
truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth .
the loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other .
in the story do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting effect the cyclist .
take my advice and buy a <caps> .
another word would be being patient .
my final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer .
but if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it .
<caps> forgets that <caps> has one of his own .
they saved us a spot in line .
laughter opens up a relationship to where people can feel more comfortable with one another .
<person> feeling that way made <location> and i feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up .
because not every one likes the same thing .
i get up and walk to the teller .
one book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is the <caps> of <organization> .
also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off .
i missed her like crazy .
why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your .
she is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
i would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine .
more than <percent> <date> that is kids .
<caps> had to wait for six hours before our flight took off for <location> .
but things were said to one another .
<caps> shows his gratitude for his parents moved to <location> .
you could blabber in their ear all day about <caps> responsible to do this and <caps> do this .
this way you can make arrangements .
this law made it illegal to get close to this area or even try to get tie up to the building .
then they invite you to do activities and .
however the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the <caps> side .
libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed .
the reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows .
please read on to finish reading my letter .
secondly computers help people learn new things .
the author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him .
the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself .
if the book was needed by somebody they would not be able to get it because it was removed .
i would do it on the computers if i miss it .
it gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see .
i loaded the track to .
the lesson was about <num> minutes and he was patient the entire process .
another reason is that some website are not always accurate with their information .
many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team .
another example is in paragraph <num> it says it was here i learned the real definition of family .
it had the <caps> word in there a lot .
when we get to the first stop everyone gets out with joy even me .
why cant they just allow the materials in our libraries .
then yes he did come right back .
the plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock .
the day before <num> <caps> <caps> i got all my things ready for that day .
teacher said you have tell tomorrow .
this started a very large splash war with every one splashing everyone else .
you could probably call it a clown <organization> if you wanted to .
maybe it was the fact that i was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me .
you <month> think the author needed to address a certain point more than he or she did .
in conclusion you live a happier life when explore the .
then you also have exactly the same right .
where he felt secure and cared for .
my mum is someone who is patient .
i myself thought this was a very cool plan and i was happy for my brother .
the winds would cause constantly shifting from air current .
sometimes i lose my patience when something take too long .
the features of the desert like land were fierce .
some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view .
happy because even though it was a new country the came with a purpose and are living it with their culture which is past down family to family .
this sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime .
i think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves .
bullying can lead to suicide .
also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature .
the memories he shared with his family during that time makes the mood for loving .
without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message .
i told her no and we got in the line .
its great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read .
they are only down by three .
when one book is taken down it only brings other ones into question .
the film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces .
its that one value in life we can cherish forever .
this problem was discovered when the u .
<caps> the would make him become thirsty .
so i hope you understand and agree with my reasons .
that applies to everything that could contain offensive material .
that is how harmful words get changed into names and then the next thing peers are calling other peers that word .
i would only suggest that so the kids will have a healthy thought about things .
people should have a minimal amount of time of <num> minutes each day and then get some exercise .
they also have web sites you could go on just to play them .
there are ways people can avoid seeing them .
he did not try to make his team be better than they were he just had them try their <caps> and see what the end result was .
children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library .
considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast .
the boys are making pizza if you wanted to know .
we were to jog our warm up lap and then stretch as a team .
it is not illegal for a library to have a rated <caps> movie .
a study done by <organization> shows that mere the <percent> of kids go on their computer when they cant be outside .
the author explained how the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose .
people call these buildings libraries .
my first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world .
it is better to see and understand than to enter the world blind and dumb
it would be like having someone take out a word in the <organization> .
one feature is the hot weather and area he is in .
libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building .
she i nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home .
watching videos or tweeting a friends .
she was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake .
we met through <caps> <caps> lessons at our local dance studio .
getting viruses are not cool you have to wait a week or so before they fix it .
this was a huge achievement for the <organization> .
it was like a river fellowing down my face .
then when we got off the train i said <caps> .
computers help people around the world to connect with other people computer help kids do their homework and look up staff that happen around the world .
i suggest that you will agree on my opinion .
libraries should not censor the materials they display
their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to .
<caps> screamed as his towel fell off .
and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us .
another big safety issue was nature itself .
sixteen minutes go by and still nothing .
the condition of the roads adds on to the hills .
they serve almost the same environments .
i strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer .
<caps> mom was ready to explode .
an that means <percent> of the people wont have jobs .
with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks .
i always keep sending words wrong .
with four kids it is bound to happen .
the cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert .
its an escape for them from everyday life .
together we can make a change or find a cure .
not <caps> kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live .
but it is true the opposite way as well .
there was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building .
i remember going to the library all the time when i was younger .
if a reader discovers a book is offensive they should know to stop reading not finish the book then complain about offensive material .
you always have the choice to go outside and take a walk .
fresh air clear your mind .
a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame .
there are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life .
you <month> start off on a bad day then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house to your child laughing .
all my waiting would be over .
that is how the <caps> sets the tone for this story .
till i found out what she was doing i lost most of my trust with her .
i also think its caring because he understood what was going on .
we would immediately burst into laughter when one of us would say something that could be considered even the slightest bit funny .
mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians .
addiction to computers is also a very negative impact .
he or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book .
by the time we were all heading to the <location> to fly back to <location> everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict .
thank you for taking you time to read this letter .
its always important to stay fit and healthy .
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home .
sixth grade is a big mile stone in everyones <caps> .
you could be helping your family or friends out but instead playing computer games .
if we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf
the mood is very warm and welcoming .
i believe this because at one point in time my older brother and i did not get along very well .
the greatest obstacle was nature .
i heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but i kept walking .
the builders of the empire state building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there .
the wind was also a problem .
but i am going to tell you about a time i had to be patient at an airport .
we just stared at him .
finally there is no water around .
i am now an employee for <organization> .
this cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature .
a book not read <month> as well never have been written .
little by little she started gaining weight .
some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting .
my first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture .
my grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the <date> .
it was my two little brothers of course .
i think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs .
<num> out of <percent> of kids agree with <caps> science teacher <person> .
then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding .
this allows the student to get full credit for their work .
in the mooring mast many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building .
the people who have computer electric bill is always very high and for reason they are forced to pay <num> or more dollars on electricity .
me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclists mood towards the rider .
for example lets say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow .
the library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker .
i started smiling and laughing because i was so happy that he could .
many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule .
computers are good for last minute situations .
people can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals .
simple house into a home .
if <caps> embarrass yourself in front of a lot of people <caps> need to laugh it off .
then you realize you guys kinda grow apart because you never see each other and if you never talk then it gets kinda awkward .
many obstacles were taken while trying to get the empire state building to allow dirigibles to dock there .
this means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills .
computers do not benefit society today .
in conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful .
the whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous .
there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced .
when anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes .
censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing .
the setting affect the cyclist in many ways .
always stick in your gut .
i believe censorship is a great thing for <caps> youth .
and she is making the very best of the given situation .
that is why i think more people should use computers .
i waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally i leaned over and handed <person> my note .
so people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now
i believe that if you hear or read something offensive they should stay for many reasons .
parents need to be <caps> for their kids .
guess what the libraries have some of these compact discs of these artists that are played on this radio station .
so we started over and i helped him more and was very patient with him .
if the reading materials are already in the classroom they should not be removed .
we were huddling for warmth .
the features of the setting affect the cyclists attitude towards the old men .
everyone should have a choice and a right to see or <caps> to see certain material they might find offensive .
she pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable .
the conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him .
the features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist .
the sooner could be better or for the worst .
<caps> is why i think there should be guidelines or rules .
it was there choice to pick it up and read it .
well over it did they shut down the concert .
so why would you remove valuable information .
being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do .
those the meaning of patience <caps> was a time i was being patience .
the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone .
and it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends .
otherwise i would be very very bored .
the world cannot afford to censor .
they all are there for a reason .
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
i could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals .
make the change today .
and started to bandage him up .
offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
the book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out .
we all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time .
for music theres different types also .
we are all looking at each other thinking <caps> to do .
some book that get removed could insult a group of people because it related in some way to them .
libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary as well as educate you .
having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books .
after the paper work we had to wait another week because they had to fix him .
first place we go to was a strip mall that had a big party store .
when pulled up to <organization> <person> and i ran out of the bus screaming as loud as we could .
like one second they are happy and once they get off the computer they are sad .
so we were sing songs until our waiter .
while looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past .
with computers a business in <location> or somewhere else in <location> can be connected with a building in <location> .
my friends mother had enough and had to kick him out .
my mom said she was so proud of us being so patient waiting for our little sister .
personally i know that i go to <date> camp every year and make new friends .
we were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time .
the builders of the empire state building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand new empire state building to accompany this new means of travel .
but if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on .
whenever <person> was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and i would always be there for her .
all of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible .
he is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice .
i had one hour to finish it .
<person> and <organization> moved in together and started a family .
this indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future .
you cant wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe .
it signaled to me that they all must be happy together .
we should not take laughter for granted for it is something that puts a smile on our faces .
but it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf .
after school i waited in the parking lot for close to <num> minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up .
i once spent <num> hours on my computer on <caps> .
one of the problems was that most dirigibles were <num> ft long and it would be to much .
so take movies for example .
financial loss is something that many people are concerned about .
this way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter .
the determination to win and be the best even if it kills you .
in some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills .
there are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want .
you cant agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while .
all because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas .
the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced were nature and safety .
the first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness .
i like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans .
one reason censorship should not be aloud in libraries is the lack of freedom of <caps> .
individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe .
knowing that i wont see him in a long time is unbearable .
there are many forms of music .
spending time in nature is that particular persons .
computers are a great way to explore .
students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work .
my brother <person> jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump .
i think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week .
on a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people .
but if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff .
there once again he is thanking his parents .
i walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair .
it is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water .
i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home .
here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines .
i was laughing so hard i got a brain freeze .
when its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good about taking the test over again .
it was the funniest thing <person> had ever seen .
this reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit <location> and traumatized its citizens .
he is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together .
computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable <caps> and the can be fun too .
when i answer the phone half of the time <caps> <caps> tries to see if ill fall for one of his little tricks .
website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners <caps> also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic .
it made no difference to them if i trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy .
<caps> was just as if we had taken up the life of a drama-ridden teen straight out of the movies .
he is going to yell at <caps> pretty soon .
the sun was shining like theres no tomorrow .
it is funny how even hearing someones laugh can give you feelings for them .
i knew we were going to be here a while that point forward .
i nervously asked <caps> .
winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast .
the architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times .
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles .
if somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then its their loss .
he barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him .
computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people .
it was <date> when my family and i went to cedar point .
and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term .
also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer .
some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf .
i believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want .
sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination .
the computer provides websites giving information on every time you could think of .
you could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it .
that is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups .
computers show these advances greatly .
the first obstacle they encountered was designing a mooring mast that could with hold the stress of the dirigibles load .
they also added a observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the dirigible .
i think about why we laugh in general .
patient means to wait and wait without whining .
when she sees the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus .
another way to speak to friends or family is a website called <caps> .
the mood created by the author is respectful .
he is looking back on his childhood and the memories .
a video camera used on your computer .
theres games you can play to keep you occupied during the day .
you have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive .
virtual tours are becoming more and more common today .
even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around .
well i am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what i think is best for younger children to be reading .
this shows the authors gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to <location> to give him a better future .
its really not that hard .
a controversial issue in todays society are peoples conflicting views on censorship in libraries .
thats going to be a hard work to do .
to boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves .
a man does not get scared .
a time when i was patient was when i was at my dads office .
<caps> a stated earlier computers many problems in <location> social lives .
i was so happy too .
i deal with it and put up with all of this though .
<caps> middle school student .
this shows joy because they are all together .
the teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them .
we were so excited and happy .
we wanted to go out and look for a place to build a new fort .
there are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist .
and that is the mood of the memoir .
a whole new feeling overcame the room .
people sitting down at tables stared and laughed as they saw all this happen .
the mood in the story is happy .
<person> and i looked at mom and said wow moms like i know .
it was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again .
when we got home mom told us we had to clean .
the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change .
you just need to get used to their surroundings .
my older sister <organization> i jumped in line <organization> began to wait .
it is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it .
instead of <date> we thought we could pick him up on <date> .
then one day <organization> parents had decided that they wanted <caps> take a trip <caps> the lake and go boating .
the builders of the empire state building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock their .
some material have sex and violence that is offensive .
<caps> and my cousin <person> and my cousin <person> who lived right next to <caps> would always ride bike .
you might end up being lonely .
the answer is never .
those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with
until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time .
every one has such a great attitudes .
there are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist .
but computers can teach you so much more than just different countries .
mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature .
this would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street .
we asked <caps> what he wanted to do .
and i could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to .
to us this was funny but not nearly as funny as what happened next .
in conclusion i temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply .
you cant protect your children from offensive material .
the <date> <date> of school was fun .
we were in her moms room playing with this huge exercise ball .
the <caps> <caps> books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it .
computers are very helpful in todays world .
to her the geese symbolize her life in life in <location> and how she has became accustom to it .
we all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you .
it seemed as <caps> everyone from our town of five thousand was attending the game .
the setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways .
the snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey .
laughter <caps> knows that laughter is a healing medicine .
my third reason is finding out <location> things .
for one the empire state building natural structure cant handle its weight .
the people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family .
in conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best .
it out of there we were so patient .
she was calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class .
his parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him .
the main subject which is the focus of the stories my <caps> retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table .
the final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders .
everyday millions of people are on the computer for hours straight .
they even attempt to try it before they gave up .
it gives people a good education .
i was told i was going to have two new sisters named <person> and <caps> .
he also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the <location> to give their children a better life .
remember its not only fun .
i went into <caps> room and unplugged <caps> little black phone from the charger .
my mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck .
<caps> last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier .
in conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen .
people would like to learn about different things .
they can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to .
the mood that was created by the author is loving .
where i was extremely patient .
<caps> <caps> my cell phone buzzes in my pocket .
in the horrible <num> degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that hes at risk of running out .
so i started to look into joining the <caps> <caps> team .
i will now get into more detail on these three topics .
computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster .
this would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so .
finally we came to the front of the line .
but it is <caps> and <caps> because they his parents had him and they had a house feel like a home to him .
the <caps> was amazingly epic .
the wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around .
this shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are .
i was waiting patiently for my mom .
also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations .
it could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet .
all computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it .
she bought herself a flower to cheer herself up .
it was on this perfect day that my friendship with <organization> was founded .
to me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments .
this is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for <caps> their parents do for them .
the lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store .
a last example would be in paragraph <num> when the author describes the safety hazards .
my second reason would be education .
i think that it is a persons own personal decision dealing with which library they go to .
<caps> <caps> a day where there are no books in the school library .
laughter is a sign of good relationships .
for example the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
one day me and my brother went hunting at <caps> oaks .
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes .
the last time in the story <caps> the regard they <caps> will always remember her homeland
laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day .
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life .
there was one <caps> in life when i was patient .
every wall was filled with endless color .
so had to come right back in the house .
most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset .
one rainy afternoon on a <date> my little brothers friends mum called and needed me to babysit .
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them .
well i have been there .
the final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law .
i even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a because .
finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination .
as you can see i need my computer for many things .
many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who i was able to connect with through laughter .
computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this <date> .
we turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush .
can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime .
when i was in what i believe to be the sixth grade i went to <organization> .
without all the useful information i found on the computer .
she was <caps> neat and clean that she got promoted .
he wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream .
just as my friend and i were in the car .
i had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door .
thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books .
it also is to show she is adapting to her new home .
so <caps> got out of the and walked about a <num> of a mile to the ticket booth .
so many uses for the computer .
do the same for us .
after they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play .
but as second road sign appeared he was relieved .
the author makes it so that you want to be <caps> and being able to smell the good food .
i believe that the book or magazine or <caps> should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it .
i had asked my mom and my dad if i could get it .
defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports .
the simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books .
a specific situation happened when i was about nine years old .
there is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there .
all in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific books
on our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew .
computer says computers are information in a compact <caps> out of <caps> people use the computer learn about far away places .
by growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need .
it curved right and the glove cracked .
another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can <caps> us communicate with our friends and family .
going over all those hills can really tire someone out .
the biggest obstacle was nature itself .
everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions .
i was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me .
should be taken off the shelf because .
there was a long line to <caps> the tickets .
for example i read a very famous book called the <caps> of <person> by <person> .
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments .
i was working on one thing and she was working on another .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were comprehended to late .
an their admiration for their strength and perseverance .
the communists censored everything inside the <caps> <caps> .
this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them .
there was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
i shared it with my mom who laughed very hard .
if people want to view those kind of things that other people find offensive they should buy them on their own time .
one obstacle was they had to make sure that the dirigibles could dock safely .
one way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books .
if you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination .
those four hours could be spent with their families .
that is what can happen when buying something off of the <caps> .
so in the other words the computer is useful for students .
this is the mood the author creates in this memoir .
she knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home .
one of the greatest obstacle was because of safety .
all of the flowers reminded her home country .
this place <month> have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down .
i set my backpack down so that i could look for my daily planner .
an do our laundry like it was nothing .
but <caps> of this will happen if you stay on your computer <num> .
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem .
i thing that the <caps> should have all type of books in there because thats what a <caps> is for .
which means they would have to waste even more money .
he would listen and care as if it was his problem also .
and bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm <date> grass .
the wind at times could be too powerful .
thats what makes everyone special .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way .
just try to understand what there trying to say to you .
i really hope you will consider writing this article .
also your bills will get higher .
at <organization> they help with homework and projects .
so honestly it cant be that bad .
so all of the <num> kids start fighting .
laughter is a important part of life .
they also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face its needs .
i have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids .
he was pretty nice and very goofy .
that book would be taken away from all schools in the <location> brings us to this problem .
this is a story of a time i was of a time i was patient .
another problem was nature .
that indicates a new beginning or starting over .
this shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking .
that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework .
so i immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think .
this quote only lists a few of his problems .
high school and i was feeling pretty confident .
it took four days to get down there .
as a kid we look up to our parents .
age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material .
if a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned .
computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative .
as for me i am fine .
we walked and talked and he took pictures of everything .
i believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive .
lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge .
during the <date> my family and i went to <location> for a couple weeks .
were happy together <person> told me <caps> we lay on his bed .
in the end of the story winter hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement .
it was the first day of sophomore year .
the builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast .
if you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school .
<organization> opened the <caps> and <caps> dad was not in there .
my teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money i got .
we should teach people about them .
it should not be a big deal on what there about .
i pinned him in about <num> seconds .
in rough <caps> ahead the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him .
after being patient it really pays off .
if they are found offensive to the public .
thats when we all started laughing .
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy .
it brings us closer .
the author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test .
computers can be used to interact with another .
he could do it again .
i needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing .
if you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice .
books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written .
the memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories .
i feel that trees have feelings like us but cant talk with out a mouth .
the <caps> to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station .
the plans were difficult the blimps and <caps> could crash and the mast height was too high .
the setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up .
that affects a lot of people <date> because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer .
hearing <person> laugh again made me feel better about things because i knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her <caps> leaving .
the thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful .
if you have a computer you will have video games .
because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life .
i once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers .
i learned a lesson from <time> of to always scope out the area first before you go through it .
exercise is important <caps> people let that bobby .
computers can help everyone connect with anyone <caps> you can see computers have so many positive effects on people .
we go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh .
this time i knew it was a real love kiss .
papa <person> had asked if we were okay .
these are the items that teach us new things everyday .
<caps> was her second time going snowboarding and i have been snowboarding for about three years now .
when we got to <location> we hurry to the island school to see my sister .
the architects and engineers of the empire state building consulted with the experts .
over the next few months i waited patiently .
recently on the news i saw a segment of how at <organization> they are using robots to make surgery more efficient .
every girl for themselves .
happiness was showed in many different ways .
and when spring arrives and its still standing she can go take the test .
you bear of people using computers to do work all of the time .
this line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents for the life he lived .
i have lots of stories of when i have maid people laugh .
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood .
in both of those classes we sit next to each other though .
also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging .
there were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles .
<person> was ready to go home but <person> was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set .
i did not know <caps> was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard .
a day went by and still nothing .
parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games .
how its filled with love and culture .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change .
this would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast .
dear local newspaper- i understand that computers are becoming more of a must have in peoples everyday life .
this site was trebling .
to my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all .
computers are the devils tools .
but i feel that we can find a balance between the two views .
it was of me <caps> <person> .
some offensive things are part of <caps> and shows how things progressed from back then to now .
we were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had .
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
some books in libraries offended some people .
the story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him .
sixty-three percent <organization> the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most <organization> the time .
just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone wont like it .
also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for <num> to <num> year olds and on up .
so thats the time i was patient with my little brothers and sisters .
i personally think that reading is better <date> sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing <caps> .
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful .
he could really call it home .
there is no way to express my gratitude shows that hes just so thankful there is not way to even express it .
the setting affects the biker in many ways .
that was the game cube .
we got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on .
the computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites .
know matter what you are always be patient .
when they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one .
well if not then when you are not busy you should try it .
you can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events .
finally the biker faced his las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water .
another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story .
this is a story about what patience means to me .
then i had to just walk around doing nothing .
this is how i was patient .
everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books .
the purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff .
i felt depressed for the longest time .
she makes lots of random sounds .
if they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction
you could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to .
we ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us .
the architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium .
movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes .
this made me very unhealthy i gained nine pounds in one week .
<caps> mom and brother were out late .
my first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational .
my mom is very very busy .
here another reason why from the story .
dear newspaper <caps> <caps> my name is <person> and i am a student that attends <organization> .
i started laughing because i thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack .
this creates a loving and family mood .
we went to the <organization> for children .
now lets talk about something .
these are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful .
she said and that was the <date> thing she said to me until we reached our destination .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law .
laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons .
another obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen .
the song <organization> by the <caps> <caps> was playing in the back ground .
all of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive .
and had the flavor of battery acid .
some people do not agree that computers are good .
i am able to understand how thirsty he is .
i complained again .
later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the empire state building .
it makes them happy .
so i was patient playing in my room with all my toys .
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out .
this once again made me feel sad and depressed .
in this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving .
then probably on his merry way to his destination .
computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no .
with this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support .
<caps> appreciates that his parents immigrated to the united states so <caps> can have a better life .
people will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer .
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another .
i got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line .
she will take the test again .
i do not really understand that .
my <caps> <caps> came to the door first to greet us .
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live .
my voice was kinda shaky and i thought i was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at <caps> <caps> said .
we followed <caps> sister to the ride .
that was a time i was very patient
let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil .
even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff .
the parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun .
they sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in <location> to give their children more opportunity .
this all happened because he listened to the old guys .
<caps> i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life .
he said it was hot and that he was lost .
there should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history .
if a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed .
when you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money .
it also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers .
i was dying to go on it .
another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water .
we got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room .
he always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down .
the last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships cant fly too low over urban areas .
music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves .
one of my examples of why i disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone .
i cant imagine completing any assignment without computer on my .
another obstacle that the architects faced was safety .
i paused for a long time .
<percent> of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends .
laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life .
now when <caps> tries out .
we as <caps> <caps> take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a <caps> .
my kept saying <caps> you will be able to go out .
like he said in the memoir i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home .
that way you could finish your story in time .
trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time .
<person> was her name and she drove a bright orange <organization> .
there are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive .
this makes the author need more water than he normally would .
when a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like .
i would go on the computer and get all the information i need .
he says family had nothing to do with being a blood relative .
censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own .
the cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved .
i always give it my all when i feel like that .
laughter is needed in life to make it more livable .
after the first couple minutes of class i had found that the rumors were true .
there are three reasons why they should have censorship .
she refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is .
they were full <caps> and she wanted to bake something traditional for them .
teenagers are teenagers they must have technology .
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong .
i do it why cant you .
far from the reach where kids and children are able to access .
this can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers .
when allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles .
but laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better .
these are the three reasons why i think the effects of the computer are bad .
computers have varies websites such as <caps> and <caps> which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework .
every year more people become impatient .
in all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle .
the author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there .
this would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the empire state building .
you have all these things you condo .
i was one of the last people off our bus which means i was one of the last to order .
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in .
<caps> you for letting me know that .
the variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular .
also in there houses they have music going on all the time .
i had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him .
i could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here .
because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water .
well thats what i got for using the <caps> for knowledge .
this shows the authors love for culinary skills .
since your eyes are already bad you might think well they cant get any worse .
you <month> be thinking that we just do it for fun and that its enjoyable and nothing wrong with it .
computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too .
thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her .
mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words .
that was a time where i had to be very patient .
i am most patient during tests .
going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy .
thats why people should use the computers .
i had missed about an inning of the game already .
it also allowed to see how full and good his was to .
there was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything .
you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers .
i was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was .
my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer .
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation .
that was the only time i was patient of learning .
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways .
<caps> he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh .
the law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
so when i see him running all over the place it makes me laugh .
there are <num> big reasons .
i was finally their i ordered my burger when i was done it was worth the wait .
i believe that computers have a baseline effect on people .
i had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it .
one obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars to the worth of modifications for the buildings framework .
thats almost everyone .
people were waiting for their flight to <location> .
later that day my <caps> and i were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway .
when the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain .
a time i was patient at <organization> .
nothing is causing obesity in <location> them computer .
my younger sister warmed up to him first .
<caps> i thought her cloth need changing .
i also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about .
we kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it .
those book <month> also have bad language in them to .
in the story <person> always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile .
one reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination .
one example was in paragraph <num> .
most people would be offended and complain .
<caps> took a little while but <caps> was my turn next .
this is a very opinionated topic .
each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive .
the bus drivers hurried their way to the <caps> <caps> .
it was dead silent .
everything that was on <caps> was not as bad in my opinion .
its just easier to live with it .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong .
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created .
i would let them know how i felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner .
computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life .
i said before laughing again .
all the facts of life and the world are put into it .
most dirigibles <caps> using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen .
it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women .
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to <location> due to jobs .
during this decade many sports games have come out for the computer .
playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer .
the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom .
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers .
the flower makes her happy and reminds her of home .
in the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other .
i just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest .
foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with .
she snatched her keys and we hurried into the car .
not all laughter is not funny .
i asked my dad <caps> i could use the computer .
then also the thing i can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because i always want to do something every second .
i got news for you .
they thought that she should not listen to <caps> because the lyrics in the songs were too sad for her to hear .
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
with computer you can look up available homes and apartments .
for example if i wanted to i could talk to someone and the <caps> and clean my room .
you should be with your family and and friends .
television is basically the same for movies .
laughter brought me to a good place in life .
just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life .
thats how i feel about censorship in a library .
it was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza .
then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile .
<caps> i know i said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this .
patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman .
the authors mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving .
books can be helpful defending on when it was made .
you have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library .
no matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it .
hes excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path .
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood .
a majority of peoples time is spent on the computer .
i remove the previously stated graphic romance novels .
i remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books .
this was going to be a long car ride .
it keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn .
they are both rated differently on levels of age .
looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs .
then <person> though to herself i got to be patient .
you can find this all out on the computer .
when he see the first comp he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again .
but all she noticed was my hysterical laughing .
her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her drivers test again in the spring .
a third obstacle they were facing was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you .
censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it <caps> wrong .
we were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because thats were the boys will be hanging out and sleeping .
and how important he learned that family and friends are .
this features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind .
the funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were .
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read .
while using a computer you can <caps> many things .
i jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen .
the author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time .
this factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state .
she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images .
<caps> this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area .
i turned even to see the stud coming down .
the mood of this memoir is that <person> is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family .
my grandmother shared a memory about when i was <location> learning to read .
now the lunch line .
being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day i learned my lesson .
one problem was actually docking the zeppelins or dirigibles .
the main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer .
that made us realize that we were a lot alike .
this quote shows how the girl was getting use to the united states .
filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building .
winds at the top of the building were also dangerous .
in conclusion compare use be encouraged .
some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer .
those are some of the obstacle the builder faced .
also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium .
in reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast .
with a computer everyone can learn about people all over .
going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books .
the geese come back .
i looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply i expected .
i would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand .
this is what my life felt like when the world turned around and i found out my best friend just flipped her car .
one accident and tons of lives would be at stake .
along with the students in the room .
in the story he says the bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water .
i had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before .
we could always rely on <caps> for an unrelated metaphor .
we would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives .
then in <location> next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason .
i firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive .
sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them .
in this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland .
also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on .
laughter is much more than an emotion .
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride .
instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him .
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too .
each parent has different values and standards for their child .
everyday we have choices .
laughter is what id like to call a <caps> <caps> of <caps> .
first off <caps> is a major concern many blimps were filled with hydrogen which is extremely explosive .
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands .
because we are all the same .
then i saw that <caps> from three of my classes .
patience is also about waiting .
he arrived at the first town which was a ghost town .
the fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone .
the builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat .
everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive .
i was starting quarterback and i scored <num> touchdowns and i passing touchdown just in the first half .
it was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame .
i yelled for my big brother who was playing his game .
they could what there for three hours and not be herd .
getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable .
taking media off the shelves is not needed .
second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature .
computers can the history of place not us .
but most of the time i sleep .
the author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change .
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
in the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it .
one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter .
taking away computers would drastically impact every day life .
you also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or .
we were being very patient .
we all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess .
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate .
the mooring mast on the empire state building was intentionally built for dirigible docking .
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family .
later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on <person> face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result .
he believed himself that he can be alive .
me and him meet only once a year .
i went and got them water .
<person> sat for two hours .
so the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite .
there are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir .
even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial .
laying there anxiously someone whispers here it comes .
were starting to bleed .
this would make the docking station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire .
the next lunch i went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time .
thats the order they go in from size and how hard it is to <person> them .
they put <money> of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building .
he said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home .
the setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist .
the third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible .
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself .
this session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us .
you see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them .
the dirigible could <caps> over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all .
although technology is progressing computers are only the basics .
he was given back roads that are abandoned now .
laughter is a huge part of anyones life .
thats why they should not watch it .
i looked at the contact .
i said that i did not know how much it is .
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed .
magazines in my opinion should be censored .
like for example rap music .
thats <caps> different place .
i also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from .
my boyfriend and i met about three years ago .
i sat there with tears in my eyes .
computers are a waste of money .
friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives .
if a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so .
restrictions on renting that material could be set .
the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars .
everyone needs to hear it because <caps> true .
nothing should be blocked from the public .
knowledge of suicide is also something i think should be available .
this memoir is all about heritage and the home .
i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult shows .
they went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her .
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test .
and very generous because her parents moved for her education .
the fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the empire state building was not approved by nature .
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work .
my mother did it big for my birthday party .
however thats what his parents did .
the terrain during the cyclists journey greatly affects him .
he had people at his house for dinners .
the mood created by the author is touching .
magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world .
i was in class waiting i new that it would come soon .
these were a few of many obstacles the workers faced
another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future .
such as <organization> word .
<caps> mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends .
<caps> book can be given a nasty comment but then again <caps> book can also be given the best comments .

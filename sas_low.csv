An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
I don't know what is going on!
I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate.
"Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers."
You would need to have four seperate but identical containers.
And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored.
1).
"Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic."
^p 2).
Put each sample into 4 different containers.
^p 3).
Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers.
^p 4).
^p 5).
Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min.
^p 6).
Determine the data of each sample.
^p 7).
Record your data.
You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
There could be more than 1 test for each sample.
There could also have a constant added to the expariement.
Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them.
Use the same weight of each sample.
What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples.
Your going to need how much is there in total.
^p determine the mles.
Also a total of the data could have been better too.
"""""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes."
"Instead of putting """"Determine the mass of each sample""""."
I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are.
The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
Also they should have stated what they were investigating.
They should have made a conclusion from the results.
They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
You should repeat each step in the experiment.
Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
Also try another sample.
"You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic."
"After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again."
Tools.
I
You need limestone and marble.
In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial.
"Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass."
"Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic."
I would follow the procedure step by step.
Pour the vinegar into their containers.
Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours.
May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers.
3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place.
^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on.
^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp.
by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period.
You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes.
You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse.
Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
The information the students left out was the control.
After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed.
"Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis."
Not many materials are listed.
The additional information you need to replace the experiment.
"You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles."
You test all of them in different containers.
It will give you the mass of the experiment.
That is what it need to replace the experiment.
How much of the material did they put into each container.
Was there a controlled part of this experiment.
Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with.
All these need are the true basic's.
Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
Also backround information is important to any experiment.
Then go and daght a lab report about QV.
"Then when your done, hand it Qn."
More you could repete the expierement just see it.
The limestone have mass than all of them.
A hypothesis was needed in this experiment.
You would need 1).
More trials 2).
Different types of samples and 3).
Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use.
What was the purpose for them doing this experiment?
^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way?
You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger.
Also they should have a hypothisis.
Why do you need vinegar?
Where does the acid come from?
Also I think they should have one more trials.
The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
"Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble."
"Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers."
^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label.
Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
NSR
what material did you use to get this answer.
What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
Why they even did it is in the first place.
And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
I would have to check the mass of four different samples.
Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers.
While waiting 24 hours.
"Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers."
Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was.
I always label how much of an amount to put into a container.
In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours.
More water and vinegar would be needed too.
I would need to know how
You wouldn't need any information.
They provide you with all the information you need.
Why each steps of the procedure is being done?
3.
I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to.
Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
I would write what
"You will need a solution, results and a conclusion."
Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container.
After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry.
You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment.
How much do you pour in the containers.
They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes.
Then see how it changes during the day.
In order needs say the information.
"The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic."
Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24.
Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
Find the average of the samples.
To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
"Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this."
That's how I would replicate the experiment.
1.You will need on hypothesis.
^p 2.You will need a independent variable.
^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
"They got information, but it did not have any mention to it."
Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
What would that do to the samples.
"Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g."
Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
"3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers."
^p 4.
^p 5.
Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
To make a hypothesis.
^p After to make a conclution.
^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables.
It's still missing the control group.
The indepent variable is the change in mass.
"You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass."
By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
I would need to determine the mass of four different samples.
I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
Make sure to include at least three pieces of information.
"Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information."
Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes.
"^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample."
some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis.
So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started.
So you will know when to start the 24 hours.
So you can drain them and let them come out.
You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours.
Label what liquid you used for this lab.
1.
Determine the mass of four different samples.
^p 2.
"Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid."
^p 3.
Use three different kind of containers to see what happens.
^p 4.
^p 5.
Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min.
^p 6.
Determine the mass of each sample.
An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
First you need vinegar.
Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water.
After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
When do you pour the vinegar in the containers.
And what does distilled water mean.
"I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic."
You would also need the total of all the samples.
Make sure they start with the same mass.
"In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples."
"The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic."
"Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample."
The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
Finally determine the mass of each Example.
"What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?"
needed to replicate this experiment
"Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too."
You never know you can mes up.
What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
Find the difference in mass.
You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers.
And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses.
-Change the amount of havre.
"^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers."
"You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers."
The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
"You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar."
You will need to do the same steps over.
"But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles."
Also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment.
What was the mass after 30 minutes.
^p What was the mass after 24 hours.
^p What was the influence between each time.
"The mass,use different mass."
"Different type of materials and different containers,"
Which container lost less mass?
Which container lost more mass?
You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample.
I'd need to know what to lable the containers.
The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass.
"Measure the amount, after the 24 hours."
The mass of four different samples.
^p The time for them to sit.
^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample.
^p Distilled water better.
What was their prediction before they start.
After check if their prediction was right or not.
I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak.
Make sure they are dry before making on.
Don't let any types get mixed up.
So it would have a different answer.
"This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass."
That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
"Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass."
The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass.
"Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass."
Also record the lowest and highest mass.
"Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart."
Then you will need to get four new samples.
And determine the mass for four different samples.
You need some pictures and a statement.
1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time.
"^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes."
"^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar."
^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
You would to add the labels again.
"What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion."
But don't have to find the mass between each object.
Additional information you would need would be to put more time.
A list of constants ^p 3.
Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
Don't know.
You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy.
Then we get plastic of starting mass.
We need to know more about how they did this experiment.
More details is better.
"The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment."
They need to separate that experiment more when mac.
Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
Tell us to do it again.
"Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them."
You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
I think the project needs to change
First the stat mass should of been the same.
It didn't give enough information.
1) Gather materials.
^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label.
Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container.
^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins.
^p 6) Determines the mass of each.
^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
"If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it."
(different prosseces are created)
These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem.
Calculate the averages from your two trials.
Also the independent and dependent variables.
I think what I will do is to change the procedures.
1.
Gather materials.
^p 2.
Put on apron & goggles.
^p 3.
Set up materials.
^p 4.
Por vinegar into a identical containers.
^p 5.
"Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers."
^p 6.
"Put name on container, wait 24 hours."
^p 7.
Rinse the samples with distilled water.
^p 8.
Put samples out to dry.
^p 9.
Determine the mass & other differences.
^p 10.
Clean up materials.
"Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams."
Draw a conclusion.
Say what you are experimenting.
I will need to collect all of my materials.
i will need four containers and my four samples.
i will have to place the four samples in the containers.
Then put
you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was.
By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings.
And last the group should have said their control.
^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
Be they repeat it.
Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup.
And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
"Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples."
Determine the mass of four different samples.
I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe.
They could of extended the time.
"Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers."
Place a sample of one material into one container and label.
A.
In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't.
They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
That's what a students conclusion would look like.
Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
"Also, what the different plastics are made off."
Well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions.
A.
They could of put the time period a little longer.
Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
Plastic type A was the strongest.
They also could have named the different type of plastics.
For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one.
"To improve, they should make a bar graph."
Also add heavier weights.
A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7.
I think e 11/12 40/40.
This means it went farther.
"But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same."
This is not a very big change in length.
So this was not a very succsecfull lab.
My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2).
"Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm)."
And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1.
The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic .
And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
"3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the."
^p b.)
^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
For example plastic type A first.
Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change.
I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break.
"Also, could've added more weights."
^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1.
Also to use different plastics to see different results.
The plastic streched more and more each time.
The conclusion
For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point.
^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to.
a.
"Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b."
"Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1."
^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics.
Their data could have been put clearer also.
So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic.
Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control.
^p A) Polymer Investigation.
The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types.
He could have listed all materials first.
Also he could have timed longer.
A.
Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic.
In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B.
Another way was to create a graph.
^p Name the plastic being used.
Add how much each plastic streched.
To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
"For example, plastic bottle or wrap."
"Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched."
"In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1."
The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability.
And change the trials.
A.
^p B.
In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest.
To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table.
They not only tried it once they tried it twice.
"Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more."
Use different materials.
^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
Trial D has better performed better.
Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
A.
Plastic type D is the p
Trial two it was stretched 1mm.
Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm.
Also the last trial it stayed the same length.
Both were investigated at the same time.
Or use different types of weight.
I shows that T2 can strech more than T1.
^P B).
The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others.
They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
For the name of color the plastic.
The students could of lable the chart better than the did.
a.
^p b.
Plastic type D stay the same .
They should had left more minutes to hang.
T1 and T2 are very close with their data.
They could have named the plastics.
According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable.
B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial.
(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well.
^p b)
For both trials they had similar results.
Still showing that type T2 was the best choice.
It showed that in the end type B was the strongest.
Most of them was 2 or 1 difference.
D stood the same.
The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see.
"""The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched."
^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
a.
This base on the types of bag.
^p b.
We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
It stretched the most.
Plastic type A was the weakest.
b) 1.
Perform the second trial different than the first.
^p     2.
Repeat with fresh plastic.
^p     3.
Add more than one types of plastic.
Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
I dont think his stretchability investigation work.
Based on the data.
b.
The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs.
they could have organized their data alot better.
One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights.
Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher.
"In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up."
For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail.
"But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same."
Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most.
The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices.
"Also, they could of used heavier weights."
Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability.
^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
3.
Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialist.
They both are different from a python because a python is a generalist.
"Pandas eat bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves."
But a python is a more diverse and invasive animal.
I eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians.

And koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
The phython can eat anything pretty much.
Thats how the phython is different from the pandas and koala.
The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo.
Pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
"Verse pythons are """"generalist"""" that could eat anything."""
These two bears on aren't harming anything by eating the foods.
But pythons eat almost anything that moves and they are harming the enviornnent.

They eat plants.
They are different from pythons because would not take over a land.
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
"They differ from pythons, because pythons could adapt and eat anything."
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia.
Both of these animals however are different from pythons.
Pandas that live in China eat almost nothing but bamboo.
Koalas in Australia eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves.
Pythons are specialists because they can adapt.
"Unlike the python, however, they do not eat other animals."
Pandas and Koalas are different from pythons because pythons eat alligators snakes could spread.

"Pandas and koalas are just like humans, warm blood."
Panda's an koalas are different from pythons.
Pythons are generalist.
Generalist favor change unlike pandas are koalas pythons can adapt to various climates.
There different from pythons because pythons live in warm climate weather.
The panda in China and the koala from Australia are both considered specialists.
This is because in order to survive they need a stable environment.
The panda eats only bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves.
This differs from the python which is a generalist.
Like pandas and bamboo or koalas and eucalyptus leaves.
The panda eats just bamboo while koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves.
While pythons will eat anything they can fit in their mouth.
They differ from pythons because pythons are harmful and they will attack humans.
"Although they both eat plants, it is specialized which plant."
Pandas and koalas dont stransle their pray like pythons do.
Pandas and koalas are very similar to each other.
"For one, they are both specialists."
They both differ to the python because the python is spreading rapidly.
which means that they are spreading rapidly.
They're different from a python because pythons are generalists.
A snake is able to adapt better than a koala or panda bear.
Pythons can live in many places and they do well around humans.
Pandas tend to eat nothing but bamboo.
Pythons are more abundant.
Pandas and koalas are the same because they're both specialists.
"""Panda's and koalas are surprisingly similar species."
This is because they're specialist.
They are limited to a particular region of the world because of their diet.
"""""What favors generalists is change."
"What favors specialists is stability"""" (Achenbanch5)."
"In conclusion, pandas and koalas differ from pythons."""
"As a result, these animals are less capable of adapting."
"A python however, is much more flexible."
It is a generalist species better suited for survival.
While generalists adapt and can eat multiple types of food.
They are different because they live in different enviornments.
They are different then pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere.
They are also similar because they only eat one kind of specific food.
"A snake is a generalist just like a human."""
Pandas and koalas in Australia are similar is that they are both stable.
In paragraph 24 it says ''what favors specialist is stability.''
This show show they are both stable.
This is how they are alike and different.
"This one thing is their diets."""
They need stability to live.
The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both mamals.
A panda eats nothing but bamboo and an Australian koala only eats eucalyptus leaves.
Neither of them could survive where their food isn't supplied.
A python doesn't just have to live in one location.
"The bamboo and eucalyptus, generalists can eat anything mostly."
"""""A generalist is a raccoon, a python""""."""
Although the koala and panda are different from pythons because pythons are generalist.
China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialist.

It's also a invasive species.
"Well for starters, one is a snake."
They can only live in one area.
"Pythons are specialists, so they can live in a large range of places."
Pandas and Koalas are both endangered animals they are both being protected.

When Pythons would eat anything and they are Huge.
Predators they can kill and eat things bigger than them.
They also live in all different places.
They are both different from pythons because they are not reptiles.
While pythons can eat different kinds of animals and survive in different environments.
"""""A specialist is china's panda or Australia koalas bear."
Pythons are seen in multiple location in remote regions of the Everglades.
Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and pandas eat nothing but bamboo.
Snakes eat mice and other things that are etable for them.
Any thing that alive and they can put down there mouth.
They both do best around humans too.
The pand mostly eats bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus  leaves almost exclusively.

Invasive meaning not normal or dangrous.
Invasive means they do different things compared to other animals.
Invasive is a significant word because of the way it sounds.
So it gives the story and makes the endangered animals sound bad.
"Invasive, means living in vast."
/ dry places such as a desert or Florida.
The signifiance of the word invasive is unfair.
Invasive is passing judgement.
They're introduced.
For pythons its a wonderful introduction.
But it is basically judging a book by its cover.
All of the articles have something to do with invasive animals.
"The python, panda, koala."
But sometimes thats not always a good thing.

They use the word invasive to try to say the the reptiles are dangerous.
When one thinks of snakes it usually the jungle that pops into mind.
MacInnes thinks that they were introduced and are now fine and safe.

"After this, then the strands will form the amino acids."
"Then, you got the amino acids needed for energy and protein synthesis."
The first step is for messanger RNA to leave the nuclues.
Then the newly formed protiens are sent to where they will be needed.
Protein synthesis helps the body to function.
It helps to build the body stronger.
It makes the body feel refreshed.
Protein synthesis is very important to have.

first you have to show that the protein is alive.
next it goes to the new cell and that is all.
RNA
"With proteins, they are able to give you the needed amount of energy."
mRNA tells the oraganelles what to do to help the cell with reproducing.
It would involve replicating and dividing the cell to become two cells.
"DNA,RNA, TRANSLAION, tRNA,PROTEIN,"
it then goes to the golgi apparatus
The amino acid stays attached to the protein.
tRNA receive the messager mRNA.
The mRNA changes into tRNA or gRNA or it will change into rRNA.
"Transfer RNA helps transfer things, etc"
four major steps
"We get more healthy, no deaths, more nutrients, no diseases"
The mrna turns in to rna which is the transfered to the nucleus.
From there the rna turns in to dna as we know it.
It leaves and it creates more mRNA's and that helps your body.
And then it repeats the process again.
And it sends messages to the nucleus.
The mRNA brings the codes to the organelles that produce protein.
It drops off the codes and the Proteins are made.
then it gets sorted and it brings RNA back
"anaphase, metaphase, telophase, prophase"
The mRNA will take the codes for the protein to the tRNA.
"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the nucleus disappears."
This stage is also called Prophase.
The third stage is when tRNA is placed together to help make more ribosomes.
The mRNA sends the protein to tRNA.
tRNA sends the protein to the mitochondria.
The mitochondria uses the protein for energy.
Our bodies use that energy.

The mRNA is the messanger RNA.
There are three different types of RNA.
"MRNA, which is messanger RNA."
TRNA which is transfer RNA.
And rRNA which creates ribosomes.
mRNA passes the nucleus to DNA and DNA makes it reproduce.
Step 3:They get to the spot they need to be.
Step 4:They do the job.
"There is regular RNA, mRNA, tRNA, and protein synthesis."
You just make the letters go to their opposites.
Then the proteins leave the cell.
After this the cell works to make new proteins.

Interfase is the longest phase in the cycle.
After interfase is prophase which is the first stade of meiosis.
The second stage is anaphase which the nucleus splits in two.
The last stage is metaphase.
Then you have a new cell.

Then is will be taken to where it can get energy.
There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis.
One of them is replication.
The mRNA cells must replicate in order to leave the cell.
Next they must copy other cells.
"After that, they must duplicate."
Lastly they will zip back together to make more copies.
RNA
The mRNA is read by the tRNA.
Then it is read by the protein creating the amino acid.
mRNA instructs the protien

to take messages through the body
"Interphase, Prophase, Anaphase, and Telophase."
First a strand of dna is formed.
Then the stand of dna breaks apart.
New dna attaches to both pieces of the dna.
Another step involves RNA but that happenes after the other steps have occured.
And MRNA is small enough to fit threw the holes thats in a nucleus
"anaphase, telephase, metaphase, mitophase"
mRNA takes protein to DNA strand coping it and making new
mRNA sends a message to protein wich makes them multiply into more protein
Next it has to deliver the message to the right place in the cell.
Then attaches to the DNA strand.
The mRNA makes another copy of itsself making tRNA.
1. they have no organism 2. they have no air3.

Four major steps are that Interphase takes place.
This is where the cell completely splits.
There is Anaphase which is where the cell starts to divide.
- it has to be broken down to make the protein sythesis
The first step is when the messenger RNA replicates.
The cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created.

The last step is that it comes back together.
Proteins and amino acids are also brought to the active site.
ATP is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction.
the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria.
then you get tRNA then DNA
Protein is transferred.Protein is given a more higher level of itself.

The mitochondian breaks down the protiens.
Then it is filtered through the body and into the blood.
The protiens are used to supply energy to the body.
anaphase telephase prophase metaphase
The mRNA takes the proteins.
Then goes to another cell and transfers the protein to that cell.
Then it rides to the nucleus and dumps off the information it is carrying.

THE PROTIEN IS TRANSFERD
mRNA delivering the instructions to the DNA.
Then the DNA makes protiens.
Second they go into anapahase to make the process of making proteins faster.
"First, mRNA leaves the nucleus to go to get copied."
While getting copied they split in half and those halves get identical matchers.
Now there is two sets of the same protien.
The mRNA brings instructions to the amino acids.
The rRNA carries out the instruction with the amino acids.
Proteins are then created.
The tRNA transfers the protein back into the cell through the membrane.

He is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
He also found out that he broke records.
Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him.
So that is just what he does about it.
Mr. Leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college.
He was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip.
paul became an amazing athlete  who can't read as well.
Paul and Mr.Leonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes.
Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner.
He broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles.
He now works as a hall monitor.
He was kind of a good kid gones bad.
hes a good guy
They find alot out about eachother more and more while Mr.Leaonard is training Paul.
No school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back.
Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him.
Paul didn't want to not learn how to read.
He feels lied to.
why do i have to take this test
Also it helped Paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard use to be.
Like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest.
i really have know clue .
Paul was get help from Mr. Leonard when he need help.
There is a lot of effect of Mr. Leonard's background information.

They didnt have learning places back then.
he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him.
Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities.
Paul is used to obeying Mr. Leonard.

It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way.
It opens up a new world for Paul is what I'm saying overall.
Paul is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
"Mr. leonard is like Paul, a poor reader."
so he feels bad for him.
also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track.
He is good at track just like he was.
Also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college.
Paul ask Mr. Leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him.
Mr. Leonard got backgroung information o Paul so he knew a little abut him.
This helped him do things better.
He practiced with him.
It shows that anyone can play a sport without have learning capablities.
"Also, that Paul could learn just about anything if he had practice."
Paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises.
Paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things.
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like Paul.
so his teacher helps him and coaches him.
He didn't have a scholarship and didn't make it threw college.
He also didn't know how to read.
HE CANT READ SO HE FEELS BAD FOR HIM
He is concerned about why Mr. leonard didn't tell him.
Paul is in middle school.
He goes to a reading program twice a week.
He doesn't know how to read.
He can do track.
THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION MR. LEONARD GETS ON PAUL IS HE CAN RUN TRACK.
HE RAN IN COLLEGE AND DID NOT TELL ANYONE.
THE FOUND OUT WHEN HE RAN TRACK OUTSIDE ONE DAY.
The background information saddens Paul because Mr. Leonard never told Paul about his background.

That Mr. Leonard was a really good track runner.
Mr. Leonard was embarresed about what he did in high school but Paul wasnt
"He was sad, because Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out."
No other school wanted a runner who could not read.
it upsets paul when he hears do to he thought leonard didnt want td
he is  trying to save the worlkd
Pual asks the hall monitor what happend after the event in the picture.
But at the end  he just wanted Paul to be a good person.
Pauls track coach asked who helped him learn and get so good at hurdles.
He also found out about how he couldnt read and fluncked out of collage.
Mr. Leonard then trys to get Paul in a sport to impress the coaches.
The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.
Suddenly he realized what he could do for him.
swooooop
He helped Paul practice hurdles.
Rain or shine they still practiced.
all he wanted was to get in the big leads
Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was good at track and broke records.
the effect it had on paul was that
Mr. Leonard background informatiosn makes Paul feel bad for him.
The effect it had was that he got him into sports.
He helped Paul he wanted to make him do better in life.
And just to do the right things.
That is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center.
So he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track.
That Paul is able to do much more with this kind of help.
He is one of the select few of the remedial program.
it has a big effect on him.
1.
Not a bad first effort 2. that was terrible3.you'll do better next time
And that he went to college.
"But the question was, why he was there?"
After that it turned out that Mr.Leonard didnt learn how to read either.
The informactin that pauls learns about Mr leonard is very shocking and confused about him
It effects the story because Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same in ways.
Paul was woundering why he had left college to be a hall monitor.
Paul read how he broke record at thge college and was the best.
Mr.Leonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing.
Mr. Leonard going to the learning center
paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing.
He kept students in line and out of trouble.
he starts workimg out with the track team
Background information can actualy help Paul.
This information on Mr.Leonard makes Paul wonder why Mr.Leonard didn't finish college.
He goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read.
The words that Mr. Leonard said were all too familiar to Paul.
He felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud.
The background of Mr. Leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change.
If he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better.
It is a lesson to make school a priority of track.
Mr. Leonard use to be a runner as well.
Now he is at a high school teaching Paul how to run track.

But they found out that he could not read.
So he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college.

Paul was asked to gym
Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website.
Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run.
Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly.
The stouy was about paul whns to be the beast.
I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.

Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard.
It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it.
Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul.
he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.
Mr. Leonard was once in the same situation as Paul was in.
He told him to meet him at 2:30pm.
Then with all the trainning.
He eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track.
Paul feels embrrassment when Mr. Leonard tells him about his schooling.

and
Paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week.

It made people think of him different.
What?

Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete.
He did track and field and was very good at it.
Mrs. Leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center.
Paul met Mr. Leonard when i started middle school.
That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down.
He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read.
By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.

Paul pointed to the picture and asked Mr. Leonard about it.
He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
He broke records.
"He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete."
Paul was more interested in his life.
"'Well, what happened after that?'"
In the story it shows that he is a nice guy.
But he can be a little bit mean as well too.
But than he lost his scholarship for college.
But he flunked out anyways.
he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read

Mr. Leanard was a hall monator in middle school.
he was select few in a leraning program.
He also worked with a tutor.
He wroked with Mr. leonard with track.
I think the effect on Paul is huge.

Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling.
"From what I read, the backround check helped Paul feel better for himself."
So he relied on his friends to help him pass.

"'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'"
Mr leonard used to be a track coach.
He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records.
He had to keep that a secret from Paul.
So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read.
He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.

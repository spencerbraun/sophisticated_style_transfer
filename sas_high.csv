You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment.
You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure.
You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container.
Some additional information you will need are the material.
You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample.
Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar.
In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment.
Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are.
A good procedure would have specified this
In order the replicate the experiment you need
You would also have to know how big in size each container was.
They needed to include what time they started and when they ended.
Also the amount of vinegar they used.
Also the size of each sample.
"In this group's procedure, they do not state what"
I would also need to know how much vinegar to use.
I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
Well I would need to know what the problem statement is.
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material.
State how long you are rising the materials in water.
(ex 5 minutes)
"A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."""
"The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer."
What containers should we use?
"In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included."
The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup.
The second is to list the far samples in the procedure.
The third is to record the information obtained.
You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup.
You need a set amount.
You could also do the time at different times.
Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material.
We need to know how big the sample would have to be.
"To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail."
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure.
I would need the amount of roch in each container.
I would need the amount of vinegar of r container.
I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container.
I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.
I would also need the amount trials done.
1.A list of materials and safety requirements.
^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers.
^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
"They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."""
The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container.
They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in.
You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container.
I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment.
"Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material."
Will  we completely submerge it or only partially?
"Finally, we need to know which materials to use."
"The data indicates them, but the procedure does not."
"Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc."
This experiment is missing too much information.
"Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment.
Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added.
The students need to say what  the samples are.
They need to
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control.
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp.
Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup.
"In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information."
you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
The problem does not state what the four different samples are.
The amount of vinegar could impact the mass.
Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit.
Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator.
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used.
"Also, how much distilled water I would need to use."
"In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information."
You might also need to know to know the constants.
"What type of vinegar, and what time you started."
One thing is the amount of vinegar used.
Another is How much water to use when rinsing it.
The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours.
There were a few problems with this procedure.
I think the students should have started out with the same mass.
What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.
^p 2.
)The types of samples used should be in the procedure.

"Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate."
Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume.
And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups.
I would need to know where to put all of the different containers.
or by a light source makes a difference too.
"""These students procedure was not  a reliable one."
The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses.
"Is there only reducing to ism the """"sample."""""
They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup.
The material also that not  include in control groups.
which is a centered post or any experiment.
They student variable unchecked.
"They also included only the trial."""
"-In step 1, we need to know what samples."
It should list the 4 types of rock.
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure.
For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used.
"In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass."
"""1."
"What kind of """"sample of material"""" are you using."

"They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."""
I need to know how much vinegar.
"I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers."
I need to know what the four different samples are.
The greas would need to identify
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment.
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment.
The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without.
The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain.
That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab.
I would need to also know which type of container to use.
So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled?
And what are the four different samples?
These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment.
Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
Explain what the four different samples would be.
^p 2.
Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup.
^p 4.
Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
"), and how long to rinse for."
How much vinegar rinse or how long
Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container.
Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container.
I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers.
"Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples."
There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment.
I need to know what the four starting samples are.
"Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples."
I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample.
1.
^p 3.
Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing.
They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format.
How long do you rinse the samples ?
Do the samples stay outside or inside ?
Day or night ?
You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same.
They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need.
"Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use."
These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
The students need to include what the samples were.
The students should also include the temp.
that the containers were stored at for 24 hours.
"Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container."
They could've put the same amount or different amount.
They could've put little or a lot.
balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
"To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information."
I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen.
"Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup."
First they should list the samples they used.
"Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure."
Not just leaving it out of their processes.
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container.
How long to rinse it in water (materials).
And what kind of container casinial use.
I also need to know how much vinegar is needed.
"Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed."
Their are three things wrong with this procedure.
The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit.
Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ?
Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
The procedure is very vague.
A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment.
"Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic."
How much vinegar you pour into the cups.
What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
"Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment."
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information.
"For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container?"
With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
All they tell us is vinegar.
"Also, what is the size of the containers?"
How much of each sample is being poured into the container?
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup.
how would also need to know if they used the same size cup.
These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
You would need a sample of each of the substances.
As well as knowing what type of each substance you need.
All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass.
In case there was no data table present.
I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
"In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know"
You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container.
How much vineger do you have to pour into each container.
And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data.
We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
"In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information."
First you need to know what type of samples your using.
"Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be."
Having different sizes might change the results.
Another information
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment.
I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container.
"Without these, I could not replicate this experiment."
And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup.
We would also need a control.
So would need to place something in regular water as well.
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample.
The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it.
Also you do not know what the four samples are.
In the second step how much vinegar should be poured.
A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container.
Each sample should be the same size.
What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure.
They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container.
The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
^p 2.
^p 3.
How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used.
With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into .
"Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc."
All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples.
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure.
"Third, there is no control in this experiment."
They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
"It should say what each """"sample"""" is in the procedures."
"A list of materials."""
and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
"Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container."
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows.
"First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers?"
"Secondly, how large should the samples be?"
Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
You would need to know what the four different samples are.
Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers.
"Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at."
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment.
"For example, do they want us to use the same materials?"
"Of course they do, so that's one."
"Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using?"
We can use plastic or metal or another.
"Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need."
Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
The procedure should include what the four different samples are.
At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified.
The procedure should also encourage repetition.
Human and equipment errors as always possible.
Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary.
"Finally, the procedure does not include a control."
This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
You would need to know how big of cups to use.
What type of container should the sample be put into?
how should i determine the mass of the different samples?
How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
"""You need something like a scale to determine the mass."
"""""Determine the mass of four different samples""""."
You need to identify what that sample.
"You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."""
Determine the mass of four samples of what?
How much vinegar is needed in the containers?
You would need a scale to measure the different containers.
Are the different containers made of the same material?
I would need to know several things before replicating this job.
Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
More information would be needed to replicate the experiment.
It needs to be explained what the samples are of.
It should say how much vinegar to use.
"Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar."
There should be a control included within the experiment.
Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results.
I would also need to know what the four different samples were.
The additional information that should be included in this procedure is.
How much vinegar goes in each sample.
Where do the samples go to sit and dry at.
Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment.
All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples.
Should I
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1.
How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2.
What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying.
^p  4.
How big the containers are ^p  5.
What environment is the experiment taking place in?
"Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc."
The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.
It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers.
They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers.
This could effect the mass of the object at the end.
Second you will need to know the temperature of the room.
"To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed."
These additional steps would make the procedure better.
"Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal."
Throw away containers.
Also I would need to know where I should place a sample.
Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
You would also need to know what four samples to use.
Step one really should go at the end.
You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers.
Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested.
Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it.
You would also need to know what type of materials you need.
).
I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container.
The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion.
The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items.
So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers.
You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment.
One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container.
A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use.
"Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not."
Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ?
"Inside, outside, by a window ?"

Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock.
^p 2.
Determine an amount of vinegar.
^p 3.
Determine what type of containers are being used.
"""I would include the materials used or the """"samples""""."
An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance.
"It's very vague, so they should add more specific."
Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
you also need a control group.
To tell me what the samples are in the procedure.
^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers.
^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used.
the samples should be kept at.
By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
The group will need
^p should they be relatively the same size?
^p 2.
How much vinegar should be poured into the containers?
^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water?
^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
And what to use to determine the mass of them.
I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container.
I also would need to know how many trials were their.
In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
"Also, you would need to how to determine mass."
Since there as the of materials
You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample.
Different amounts of vinegar would give different results.
To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor.
I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples.
This will make the procedure easier to follow.
How much vinegar is needed in each dish.
What is the sample material.
And how do you determine the mass.
And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
"What type of container, how much vinager."
Also what you would use to find the mass.
So the all came out equal.
To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples.
"Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar."
"Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use."
^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
The procedure is unclear.
In order to effectively replicate this experiment.
It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount.

I would also need to know what the samples are.
"To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with."
"To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand."
But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.

Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment.
We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers.
We need to know this as well.
"Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1."
"By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct."
Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed.
What do you measure the mass in
And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container.
Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
I would need to know how big each individed
"Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?"
I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
I would need to know how much of each material will be needed.

^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample.
^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
"With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment."
"""To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary."
"Finally, I would need to know what to label each container."
In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly.
What the four samples are.
They should also say what the sample is.
How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers.
And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well.
Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g.
The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
"In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed ."
"First, the amount of vinegar would be needed."
"In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed."
"First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab."
I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used.
A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar.
I would also need to know what type of container.
I would even like
Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
"Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be."
In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information.
I would need to know what the samples were.

you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
Also what size container should be used.
Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at.
One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup.
"Without this information, the results would be inaccurate."
This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
It is important to have them all be the same size.
I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers.

"^p Initial amount for each samples."""
Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup.
Wha sample materials are they useing.
Was each sample poured in to.
And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water.
Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
"Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment."
"Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?"
More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed.
The size of the container needs to be determined.
Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for.
If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
"First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container."
"Second, you need a control for comparison purposes."
"Third, you need to state the size of the containers."
"Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container."
I would also need to know the measurment.
I would need to know how much vinegar to add.
They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container.
They have actually determine the mass.
"Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container."
What kind of containers?Big small?
what are the samples?
What sample?
what material?
What containers and what are we supposed to label?
the sample or what is being put into?
To replicate this experiment you would need the following information.
a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample.
^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
They don't state what the samples have to be .
They also don't say how much should the samples weigh.
They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.
Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
"Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant."
This needs to be included in the procedure.
"Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are."
"""The group was not very specific in their procedures."
Samples of what?
They never say.
In the light or dark?
"First, I would need to know what type of material is being used."
in darkness outside?
I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
"These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate."
You would need to know what samples you would need to use.
"Then, I would need to know what the three samples are."
The amounts are not specified.
The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use.
Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
I would also need to know the problem to this experiment.
"Also, around how much of the samples do you need?"
100g or 50g or 10g.
"Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container."
They must should be specific.
"""There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment."
What size and configuration should the containers be ?
"It says """"identical"""", but does not specify anything else."
"Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"""
"In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour."
The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of.
Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in.
"Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment."
They would also need to know what containers they used.
In what unit (grams?
).
"In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control."
In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar.
"After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing."
How much vinegar to use.
The temperature the experiment was conducted under.
How much of such sample should be used.
All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid.
This is needed for comparison.
A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
"Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they?"
First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container.
Also the group should use a control in this experiment.
We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container.
And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
Also what would those 4 materials be.
It never states what materials to use.
How much vinegar should be poured into cup?
There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.

How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample?
^p 3.
How are you going to measure the mass?
"First, in the product it just said pour vinegar."
It didn't say how much which is important.
I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
I would also need to know how big each sample should be.
Also how big the container would be.
You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in.
1.
What kind of samples ?
^p 2.
How much vinegar ?
^p 3.
What kind of container ?
Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically.
"Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment."
To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information.
Different environments could affect the date.
Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container.
The students should be more specific in giving the directions well.
After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know.
I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
You would need to know how big the containers were.
What containers do I put them in?
How much vinegar do I put into the containers?
Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours?
Do I cover the containers?
How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
"Also, you would need to know what type if container to use."
You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use.
The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be.
You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be.
The amount of vinegar needed is essential information.
"For example, should they be left covered or not?"
They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container.
Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar.
They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples.
If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results.
Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples.
You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs.
They don't state how they find the mass of each sample.
"Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample."
They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used.
Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are.
It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble.
A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this.
A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with.
Also what type of containers should you put the samples in?
How big should they be.
"Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2."
I would need to know how much vinegar  they used.
Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
I would also need to know what temperature.
I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours.
I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup.
I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure.
I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples.
I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution.
What are the four different samples?
There is no control so how do you know what water is.
There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup.
"Also, how big would the cups have to be?"
In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information.
We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment.
You would also need to know how they determined the mass.
You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup.
"Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample?"
"To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things."
^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time.
The amount of vinegar that each container would need.
We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment.
We would also need to know what kind of container they used.
"Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar."
Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
I would need to know how much vine
It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured.
The size of the containers you are using.
and all samples must be put in the same areas.
Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
"Also, I would need to know what samples I am using."
I would need to know what size or shape of container to use.
I would need to know how to determine the mass.
How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of.
How much vinigar must be poored into each container.
Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
"The group also need to specify what the """"samples"""" are."
"Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ?"
Darkness ?
Light ?
Both ?
This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
"Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup."
"Three, what you are measuring the weight in."
"Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours."
With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
"Other than this, the experiment was written decently."
Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
What temperature was the room at to make it dry.
How many items of material were put into each container.
Thease are some key things that need to be included.
What temp is everything?
they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar.
Also repeat twice.
You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with.
You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container.
You need to know how bigof a container.
"Additional information would include, what were the four different substances."
How much vinegar was put into every cup.
Another would be how much of the samples?
that is not specified.
"In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr"
And if it should be the same amount in all.
It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing.
You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses.
You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample.
Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need.
The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material.
^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup?
^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
"""The group stated to """"determine the mass of four different samples."
Samples of what?
Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
I would need to know how to measure I samples.
You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples.
"What the samples are, what type of containers."
One would be to say how large each sample should be.
Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
"An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific."
I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment.
You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers.
The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well.
So they should say the names of it.
There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
Where do we keep the containers?
Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long.
They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information.
Without this information our data could be different.
To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1.
)How much vinegar should go into each container ?
^p 2.
)Why doesn't it matter which sample ?
^p 3.
)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment.
Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass.
Other information
First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup.
Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same.
You would need to know what materials to get.
You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup.
They should have told us what to measure the cup with.
They should have also told us what type of container to use.
The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
The procedure is missing some critical info.
Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
"There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure."
They did not specify what type of container or how large.
They did not say what to do with the container when you finish.
They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials.
Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance.
Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use.
These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample.
"Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic."
Some additional information you would  need  a control.
^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers.
^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
How much vinegar are whe poring?
How long are we rinsing them?
They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well.
^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
"In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information."
I would need to know what were the four different samples.
How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains.
I would need to know what to label the containers.
Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
Pouring different amonts could change the mass.
this could also effect the mass of the material.
That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept.
Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using.
"Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab."
Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for.
After reading the procedure some things are still unclear.
What should we lable the 4 containers as ?
How should the samples be removed from the container ?
I would also need to know where to store the cups.
Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers.
^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass.
^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers.
^p - What kind of containers are being used.
^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers.
^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing.
The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container.
Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples.
Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
Things such as temperature are necessary.
"First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested."
The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to.
The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this.
So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
The group will need to put to the following information.
What are the four different samples.
What type of containers will be needed.
Also what size.
(The temperature should be consistant)
I would need the types of sample materials that are being used.
You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers.
How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
The procedure does not state what the samples are.
It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need.
The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using.
To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant.
In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things.
Also what siz container.
"Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers."
I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing.
The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials.
A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it.
What else is needed is to state the different samples needed.
I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used.
I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
"First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples."
"Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at."
The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z.
^p The type of container for each substance.
^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
Additional information that would be needed.
Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things.
The
They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers.
"They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."""
One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment.
You would also need to have the samples all the same size.
They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container.
They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use.
"Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for."
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information.
That would also be helpful.
Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in.
I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
"""Some additional information that would be needed are specific things."
"The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."""
Also list the type of meteral they roused.
And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
Specify what the samples are in step 1.
Specify how much vinegar in step 2.
Specify the size of the container in step 2.
In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
The students need to be more specific on their materials.
And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
The procedure left out some information that is needed.
It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
"""Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information."
"Then it needs to state how much of each """"sample""""."
You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
Just saying samples is not specific enough.
I should have the exact type of material.
"Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little?"
4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment.
I also need to know how to find the difference in mass.
1.How much vinegar & how big a container?
(Were the samples completely covered?)
^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at?
^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup.
How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing.
They have to be clear and actually name them also.
We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container.
It should have a constant mass for each of the samples.
"(ie grams, pounds,ouples)"
^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour.
I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container.
"Also, the size of the container would be helpful."
Additional information I would need to know would include several things.
I would need to know what the four samples of material are.
"First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup."
We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each.
The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements.
In able to complete this experiment.
In able to have the experiment preesse.
You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers.
(tongs)
To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers.
What are the samples?
"Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample?"
What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used?
"For long should the sample be rinsed?"""
"In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed."
It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container.
It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be.
How much sample to add into each solution.
In order to replicate this experiment.
How much should you have in each container?
They could have used more trials.
Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment.
Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be.
"Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most."
Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A.
You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability.
They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
a.
b.
"Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more."
Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results.
The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials.
"It is important to keep your constants, constant."
"C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between."
^p B.
One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything.
"What plastic, how long are they etc."
They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
A.
^p B.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm.
There for it stretched the greatest amount.
In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest.
A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most.
It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one.
"Thus piece of info is crucial."""
A.
The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm.
^p B.
Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured.
Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
B.
a.)
The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A.
b.)
One way the validity of the results could have done more trials.
Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm.
Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid.
a.
^p b.
1.
2.
The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
A.
^p B.
Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two.
"Also, she should tell what plastics were used."
a.
^p b.
For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic.
"In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm."
The least stretched plastic was type A.
"In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm."
Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
a.
"Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest."
^p b.
"A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability."
Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data.
He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
Plastic type A was the stretchiest.
a) Plastic B has the most stretchability.
Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length.
A.
^p 1.
Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment.
^p 2.
Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
"Also, the students could have conducted more trials."
The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic.
It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials.
^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added.
This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant.
The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
a)In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics.
Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period.
In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most.
Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm.
"The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."""
Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat.
The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps.
"""Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most."
^p b.)
Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most.
^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity.
a.)
Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested.
^p b.)
The students can able more trials to their experiments.
"Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used."
a.
"Plastic type B was the stretchiest, while A stretched the least."
^p b 1.)
Make sure the plastics were all the same length.
^p 2.)
Measure the plastics during the process of stretching.
D stayed the same.
^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic.
They should of said how much the clamp weighed.
a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials.
It's the stretchiest.
They could of repeated the procedure one more time.
They should of had a control grap.
"In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm."
Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid.
Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
A.
^p B.
The student could say how much weight he used.
Also increase the weight in the second trial.
The measures of every plastic should be the same to start.
"Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added."
My conclusion is that type B stretched the most.
It was easily the longest.
I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most.
Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest.
The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials.
When i get low to the ground.
How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all.
"Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also."
2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.
A.
^p B.
Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment.
"Right now, one can only guess what weight that was."
a.
The best plastic type would be A.
^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial.
Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with.
One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial.
Also by using the same weight to weights.
"My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched."
The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable.
a.
Plastic type B has the most stretchability.
"Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less."
B.
The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
"In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials."
a.)
^p b.)
In this experiment students tested to see
A.
"A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right."
Also there should have been more than two trials.
Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
Also the amount of weights you add one.
Plastic B was the most stretchable.
B.
Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5).
For instance one plastic with no weight.
b.
^p a.
"From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable."
Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
Another improvement wold be more trials.
The plastics also must all be the same length.
a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most.
A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics.
Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
a.
most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm.
Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
The weight was and how many clamps to use.
"Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to."
One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability.
A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm.
and they could have tested more types of plastics.
Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip.
This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
"According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic."
"It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2."
"Plastic type """"A"""" has the worst stretchability."
"""a.)"
^P b.)
One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it.
"Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."""
Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least.
Plastic type be was the most stretchable.
WSR
Type D stretched the same length in test one and two.
"In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability."
a.
^p b.
The student could have included how much the weights weighed.
This would make the experiment valid when reproduced.
"This is because for each trial, it stretched the most."
This adittional data will make the results clearer.
a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic.
Type B has the most stretchability.
One way they could have improved was to do another trial.
A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length.
Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3.
"For example, adding little heat."
The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3.
^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials.
Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
"In conclusion, it can be said that plastic."
Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A.
^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific.
"Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."""
This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average.
I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant.
He could have added more that's.
He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two.
The results werent valid.
Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A.
A.
^P B.
This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
a.
Plastic B was the most stretchy.
The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials.
^p b.
The students could have improved the experimental design!
They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials.
One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents .
For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same.
thing this
"^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights."
Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm.
^p Improve:(1).
^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
A) In conclusion plastic type
a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest.
It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others.
The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial.
This always verifies the validity of an experiment.
I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table.
They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
a.
"Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most."
Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm.
^p b.
The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types.
The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results.
Plastic A is the least strechable.
"Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest."
They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity.
Three trials can help make this definite.
The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic.
"and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial."
Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type.
"In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm."
3.
A.
^p B.
The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1.
Doing more trials to collect more data.
2.
Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
"Also, the student could have named the type of plastics."
"Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics."
The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B.
Because maybe the put or did different procesure.
But experiment D have the same type of stretching.
The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times.
The need to have all the materials and put it in order.
The need to have his own question.
Find his conclusion.
For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A.
Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs.
They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains.
This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately.
"Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times."
^p b.
NSR
A.
^p B.
a.)
^p b.)
a.
^p b.
"""a."
Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length.
Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch.
b.
In conclusion.
Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy.
"They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."""
Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least.
"^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added."
A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic.
"Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy."
Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12.
What is your control.
"In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest."
In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm.
Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics.
Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest.
A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second.
This way the averages would be closer to what they should be.
The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights.
2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
"I do not, however, believe these results are valid."
Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
a.
^P b.
^P 1.
The length of the plastics need to be kept constant.
"^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three."
The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched.
A.
Plastic A stretched the least.
Also they should have included another trial.
a) Plastic B stretches the most.
a.)
They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant.
a).
Plastic type B is the most stretchable.
^p b).
The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added.
In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability.
Also plastic type A has the least stretchability.
The student could have had another trial.
Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic.
"If the sizes vary, the data found is useless."
Uncomparable.
Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials.
I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable.
"Also, a control group could be added."
a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment.
"Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights."
a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2.
"Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four."
Having all plastic pieces be the same length.
2.
Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic.
"Also, the students should have specified the weight being used."
Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23.
^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are.
^p 1) Do it again.
^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more.
( We didn't know the weight of them).
They could have also repeated the trials.
a.)
^p 2.)
The ammount of added weight should be specified.
The independent variable is the type of plastic.
By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better.
a.)
The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics.
^p B.)
What were the weight of the weights that were used.
How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
The student also could have been more specific in their procedure.
One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3.
a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm.
b) The student could have had another trial to test validity.
And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
A.
Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested.
^p B.
Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C.
They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
a.
^p b.
The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics.
The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2.
Plastic type D is the most durable.
It had the most amount stretched.
My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others.
The plastics should be a set length.
Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure.
a.
Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics.
Therefore plastic type B is the weakest.
"Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate."
Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.
They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
a.
^p b.
Plastic type B stretched the most of all.
They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability.
"Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial."
a.)
Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2.
^p b.)
One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic.
A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
This will give him more control over the experiment.
The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
"In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability."
Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
Considering the plastic was already stretched.
It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial.
The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more.
In conclusion trial any
Although the groups results are not valid.
The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial.
They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic.
It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics.
Different weights would affect accuracy negatively.
The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest.
^P B) More trials.
^P Add another type of plastic.
Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
B.)
"This way it will have more time to stretch."""
This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same.
More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't.
"Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest."
Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
Plastic type A stretched the least.
They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest.
^p How much weight to rise.
^p Did a third trial.
"Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified."
a.
The length of the plastic samples should also be the same.
A.
Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials.
Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials.
Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
This is because the results are inconsistant.
In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm.
Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials.
^p 1.
How much weight was added.
2.
What do they measure length in.
"The most flexible however, was plastic sample B."
It stretched between 22-23mm.
So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples.
While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm.
The student could also say how much weight he was using.
This is a conclusion that can be drawn.
Also adding a control would be helpful as well.
This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
Then the plastic cups will stretch.
For example before 30 after 40.
"Also, plastic type A is the least flexible."
According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest.
By stating the length and type of each plastic .
The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic.
It didn't change in either trial.
"According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest."
While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm.
making plastic b have the most stretchability.
Plastic
a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap.
a.
Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability).
Plastic A was the least stretchy.
^p b.
So 25 to make the experiment uniform.
^P b.
"They could have improved validity by adding another trial."""
Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability.
The students could have done one more trial to justify their results.
"Also, they could have used a different amount of weight."
"B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm."
"If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B."
(A) According to the students data.
This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given.
"Also they could have used a control for comparison."""
It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest.
Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most.
Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
According to the students data the conclusion that plastic.
Type A stretched the most.
This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for.
You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest.
This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point.
The student should haw used the same length plastic for each.
"However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved."
The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time.
A.
^p B.
These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid.
Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes.
It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics.
Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
a.
Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time.
This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics.
Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less.
Every weight they add should be the same.
"Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2."
To improe and compare data.
Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic.
To keep data acorte.
In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.
a.
^p b.
The west flexible type of plastic was type B.
Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
"However, these students need to improve their experimental design."
This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
"Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm."
"Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm."
The students can add more more time for the weights to hang.
this data states that plastic B was the strongest.
Plastic type B stretches the farthest.
Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level.
"Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment."
a.
Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most.
From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch.
a.
^p b.
Should it be the same or different.
The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity.
"^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."""
To get the total weight added would've improved validity.
3.
A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest.
^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic.
He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most.
it stretched 2mm more in T2.
He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount.
They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant.
The length of each plastic shows the same.
If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected.
This is how they could improve.
a.
The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
For example each could be a foot long.
A.
^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials.
Plastic type A has the worst stretchability.
Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial.
They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first.
(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most.
The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B.
It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm.
That shows it has the most durability for stretching.
They should have also included the time on the data table.
They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
"For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm."
"With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm."
The students could improve their results by repeating more trials.
They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A.
Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types.
-Also specified how high up the table was.
Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2.
The student could have used more plastic.
Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
"a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable."
"^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials."
(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched.
Plastic D is the least stretchy.
One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial.
This would ensure which plastic is the strongest.
These two things must be done to ensure validity.
Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest.
^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length.
Repeat trials again (3rd time).
Both trials it had the highest length.
It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm.
It helps the validity of the experiment.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four.
This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
^P b.)
They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
a.)
^p b.)
Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm.
Based
A.
"Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least."
Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm.
"He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure."
^p B) The student could have performed another trial.
They could be specific with how much the weights weigh.
To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data.
The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
The least amount stretched was plastic a.
maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes.
Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
The most stretchable would be plastic B .
^p b.
a.
b.
A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment.
More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid.
How much weight am I supposed to add.
The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most.
For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm.
^p B) The students could have done more trials.
They also could of hard more plastics.
A.)
Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested.
Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount.
^p B.)
The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length.
Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
a.
^P b.
a.)
^p b.)
This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors.
It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used.
The plastic type B had stretched the most.
I can also see that type A streched the least amount.
"Type B though, streches the most."
This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds.
a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched.
a.
Based on the student's data.
^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic.
And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used.
Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B.
The student should have done more than 2 trials.
And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag.
So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial.
A.)
^p B.)
The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one.
We don't know the original lengths of plastic.
We only have the two lengths after they were stretched.
Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic.
^p B) 1.
^p 2.
a.
^p b.
1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most.
According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials.
Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second.
Plastic type A was the least stretchable.
It only stretched 10-12mm.
Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability.
It stretched 22-23mm.
The two trials confirm this result.
^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1.
Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment.
2.
This could help determine which plastic's better.
In trial one and as well as trial two.
Also in the table include how much each weights were added on.
As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest.
Also changing the environment could improve the experiment.
"Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most."
In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm.
On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least.
In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm.
So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another.
a.
Plastic type B has the most stretching ability.
As well as plastic A having the least.
^p b.
1.
They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
a.
^p b.
100 grams ).
Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one.
Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm.
"Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount."
Plastic B stretched the most.
Different weights can cause different results.
To conclude this experiment.
I would state that plastic B stretched the most.
In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm.
Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm.
"And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment."
a) Plastic type B is the strechiest.
^p b) The students could have done more trials.
Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable.
In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm.
a).
^p b.
Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1.
Plastic D could have be stretched.
^p b.1.
^p 2.
a.)
Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight.
A constant variable was not included.
The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy.
In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23.
The least stretchy would be plastic type A.
In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12.
The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement.
Plastic B can stretch the most.
They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
"The student should have told, how heavy the weights were."
Nor.
This would make the experiment more valid.
They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest.
They could have said how long the plastic was when they started.
They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
A.
This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable.
^P b.
They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial.
Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
"A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic."
"This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length."
They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics.
One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability.
And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
"Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc."
They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap.
And at last have more trials.
Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most.
"It could hold the most weight, without stretching."
"That will improve the results."""
Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm.
Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm.
Plastic type A stretched the least.
They could have said how much weren't they used.
They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one.
For example a graph chart.
a.)
"They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results."
More trials would have increased the validity.
Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least.
"Followed by B,D,C."
Plastic A stretched the most with two mm.
One way they could improve it is to test it more times.
a.
Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
In order to increase the validity of the experiment.
Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four.
The student could have done more trials.
They could of also tell us a specific weight.
10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm.
The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching.
One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials.
Another way is add control to the experiment.
I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic.
The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer.
This means it has more elasticity than the others.
This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers.
^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials.
That would make the hypothesis more true.
shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp.
a.
^p b.
Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials.
Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials.
Another would be to make the procedure more understandable.
Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33.
it stretched 12mm without breaking.
"Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table."
Each plastic should be the same length.
Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
a.
^p b.
Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
A.
Plastic type A is stronger than the rest.
^P B.
A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm.
^p b.
1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length.
Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics.
These students could have improved in a lot of things.
First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design.
They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B.
To know that all the plastics were the same length.
a.
Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants.
a.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability.
^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
"Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm."
"However, these results are not valid."
They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
^p b.
A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most.
In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A.
It changed by 2mm.
The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to.
Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on.
A.
In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial.
^p B.
Could have had 3 trials.
Also could have under control.
a.
Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least.
^p b.)
The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times.
He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
Type B stretched the most at 23 mm.
Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm.
Type A only stretched 12 mm.
There are many ways that the group could have improved their design.
One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic.
Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps.
This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
"Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability."
They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
a.
b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
This polymer investigating lacks numerical data.
I can lab make a solid conclusion.
The student did a good job conducting this experiment.
"Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials."
Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2.
Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2.
"Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2."
This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable.
One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m.
After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm.
The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B.
A.
The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm.
^p B.
Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A.
None of the other plastics had stretched as much.
a.
Well as we see on
Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
"Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change."
a.)
^p b.)
A.
^p B.
1.
If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate.
2.
"In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest."
The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis.
Therefore we could see how much it's stretched.
With the data recorded.
Overall plastic A is the most durable.
Plastic B was the weakest in both tests.
They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data.
They could have added more weight in the second trial.
"Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time."
Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second.
Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times.
(b).
They should have specified the amount of weight.
They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
a.
^p b.
A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid.
This student only had two trials instead of three.
Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm.
Plastic type C and D are in the midle.
Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic.
"Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most."
Plastic type A stretched the least.
Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials.
They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
^P 1.
There is no control in the starting length of the plastics.
Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results.
^P 2.
The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant.
A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability.
Plastic type B was the most stretchable.
Also if one made all the plastics the same length.
One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
"""a."
^P b.
Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2.
Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2.
"Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics."
"Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity."
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia.
"They both rely on eating just one thing, bamboo or eucalyptus leaves exclusively."
They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything.
So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive.
Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves.
"Pandas are specialist, meaning they dine on bamboo."
Koala's do much of the same thing.
They eat only eucalyptus leaves.
Both these animals are different from pythons.
"Pandas and koala's, however, can not."
Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China.
"The koala which lives in Australia, only eats eucalyptus leaves."
They are similar because they are both specialist animals.
For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively.
They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species.
That means that it is able to adapt to changes.
"It can eat a variety of things, it can change."
"Pythons are generalists, who aren't very specific in what they eat."
Pandas are similar to Koalas.

First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome.
"Next, the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides."
"Then, the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon."
"Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome."
The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon.
"Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction."
This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome.
A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
1.
"The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2."
The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.
After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code.
4) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins.
1.
The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2.
The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3.
"The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA, to begin protein synthesis.4."
Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop.
1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2.
tRNA creates codons from anticodons3.
rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4.
Amino acids link together and form a protein
1.
The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2.
Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3.
This will continue until it reaches a stop codon.
1.
The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.
tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.
It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.
3.
The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.
The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
"At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons."
They are then held together by a peptide bond.
The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA.
"Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein."
The anti-codons are joined by amino acids.
A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.
"First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA."
The tRNA codes for an amino acid.
"The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind."
The amino acids bond.
Then the chain of amino acids is released.
A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes.
At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA.
This happens continuously to make proteins.
1.
The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2.
The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3.
The two produce a chain of amino acids.4.
The chain of amino acids create a protein.
The chain that is created is a protein.
1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2.
The tRNA is released from the ribosome.
In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm.
"There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA."
The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.
Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.
When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains.
"First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it."
The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA.
The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.
Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.
These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA.
2.
4.
"For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid."
"After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA."
1.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome.
"Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA."
"First, mRNA leaves the nucleus."
"Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome."
"This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein."
It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.
Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome.
It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons.
The mRNA enters the ribosome.
The starting codon is always Met.
"Finally, the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA."
This signals the end of protein synthesis.
"First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome."
It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.
The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.
This forms an amino acid.
1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2.
When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3.
tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand.
4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.
"During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription."
"Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm."
Translation takes place in the cytoplasm.
A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins.
The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA.
When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.
Transcription occurs here.
The mRNA is being transcribed.
Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids.
Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain.
This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain.
replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
(2)The mRNA is then read by the ribosome.
"After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell."
"The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin."
The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA.
"After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein."
The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons.
These codons code for specific amino acids.
"The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA, forming a protein."
1.
A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA).
Translation Occurs;2.
Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3.
Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA.
4.
Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured.
New proteins are made.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.
"There, it attaches to a ribosome."
The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.
The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.
"As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein."
1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2.
tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3.
rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed.
4.
An amino acid chain forms
It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence.
mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis.
The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA.
tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA.
the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome."
The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon.
Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA.
"The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid."
This chain will be a protein.
The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.
Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.
As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.
it then goes to the ribosomes.
The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein.
This process terminates at a stop codon.
The result is the newly created protein.
1.
The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2.
3.
The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on.
4.
1.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2.
The mRNA finds the ribosome.3.
"The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it."
It then goes to the ribosome.
1.
The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences.
The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4.

-Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane.
2.
"Cells also use osmosis, which is diffusion but with water."
Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis.
Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane.
These help to move different things across a cell.
Osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane.
Passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane.
Assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane.
"Diffusion, movement from high to low concentration."
"Facilitated Diffusion, energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration."
"Osmosis, is the movement of water through the cell membrane."
A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion.
Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.
Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion.
Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane.
Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane.
1.
This process requires no energy.3.
No energy is required for this process.
One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis.
Another process is diffusion.
Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane.
This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane.
Only some substances can leave and only some may enter.
The third process is the permeability of the cell.
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane.
Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell.
Neither of these require energy for the cell to use.
1.
"Cells can use Passive Transports, which is where there is no energy used.2."
"Cells can use Active Transports, which is where there is energy used."
Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration.
The first type of movement is called active transport.
This type of movement requires energy from the cell.
The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion.
In this type of transport the cell does not use energy.
The last process is passive transport.
This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell.
1.
Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2.
Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3.
molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles.
"These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis."
"Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does."
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
1.
The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane.
2.
Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient.
An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis.
Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement.
The plasma membrane is semi-permiable.
It allows water in and out without trouble.
Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins.
These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails.
This membrane is water soluable.
1.
Osmosis: Diffusion involving water.
"The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced."
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane.
Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport.
Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane.
"However, endocytosis is a form of active transport."
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.
These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.
The protein channels allow certain things to come through.
It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration.
One process used by cells is endocytosis.
This vesicle can now travel into the cell.
Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.
Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.
This requires energy.
Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane.
Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy.
"A cell uses diffusion, osmosis, and transportation."
"In diffusion, substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane."
Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane.
There are two types of transport: active and passive.
This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy.
This is a typw of active transport.
Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water.
Another way is by facilitated diffusion.
This type of diffusion requires ATP.
A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis.
Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell.
This process occurs by diffusion.
1.
This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.
The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.
1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2.
Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell.
A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain.
1.
Energy Required.2.
Passive Transport: Used to move substances through the membrane without using energy.3.
Osmosis: Moving water across the membrane by way of carrier protiens.
Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane.
Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this.
A passive transport uses little or no energy.
One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport.
Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane.
Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.
Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane.
"Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion."
"Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens."
"Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane."
Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell.
1.
passive transport where the need niether energy or a key
Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell.
passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal.
Osmosis.
The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport.
The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport.
The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient.
Diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration.
Osmosis is diffusion only it is with water.
Facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules.
"Their is active transport, passive transport, and then their is gradient transport."
Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell.
Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane.
Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.
The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.
Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.
Active Transport is one of the three.
This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell.
The next process is passive transport.
This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell.
"osmosis, which lets water in and out of the cell."
"THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport."
Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances.
The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration.
It uses no energy because it still diffusion.
Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration.
This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.'
Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane.
One major type of cellular movement is passive transport.
"The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water."
The cell can also use active transport to move substances.
Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.
The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis.
This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy.
Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane.
Endocytosis.
Exocytosis.
Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell.
"Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water."
Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane.
"It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic."
These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy.
Cell mebranes are semi-permeable.
Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.
Type one is passive transport.
Type two is active transport.
Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane.
Cells can also use diffusion.
Active transport requires the cell's energy and exports things out of the membrane.
in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell.
Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell.
The first process is possessing a passive transport.
The second process is osmosis.
This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane.
Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.
Active transport is also used.
ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.
ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.
Protein carriers also control movement of substances.
Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane.
A cell's membrane is selectively permeable.
Cells also use passive and active transport.
Passive transport requires no energy.
"Some form of passive transport include osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion."
This is when the cell does not require energy to move.
Material just flow through the cells pores.
Active transport uses energy.
Passive transport does not require energy.
the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane.
Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane.
"Through osmosis, water can freely pass through the membrane."
Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane.
These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane.
1.
2.
3.diffusion when
One movement process is called osmosis.
This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane.
Another process is called facilitated diffusion.
The third process is called diffusion.
This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane.
"Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy."
One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis.
Osmosis is moving water across a membrane.
Another process is using a protein channel.
The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids.
Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane.
Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy.
The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.
It lets oblects in or out of the cell.
Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.

This information impacts Paul greatly in the story.
His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.
Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.
He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon.
They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles.
Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well.
Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.
This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng.
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'
Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands.
This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read.
"Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard."
He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely.
He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.
"Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team."
It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before.
The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence.
Then Mr.Leonard explains everything.
Though it didn't seem like a problem then.
Since he was going through the same.
He was good in a sport but not so good as a student.
Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt.
"Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background."
"As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor."
This made Paul respectful and obedient to him.
That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics.
This simply increases the respect he has for him.
Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past.
"And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills."
HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more.
When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him.
Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard.
"They both can't, or have trouble, reading."
Plus they are both track hurdlers too.
Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past from the high school track coach.
He is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences.
"You know that he surprised because, he confronts him about it."
Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete.
The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul.
Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read.
Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
The narrator is surprised at the information.
He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star.
Mr. Leonard too could not read.
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
This show how he felt the need to return the help.
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track.
He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles.
"However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college."
This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman.
The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him.
He said he couldn't read and that he flunked college because of it.
Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard and make him feel better.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul.
Paul now looks up to Mr. Leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles.
Why?
Was because he didn't know how to read.
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read.
Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read.
It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard.
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through.
The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative.
He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done.
You broke records.'
"and he said, ' I lost my scholarship and flunked.'"
The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way.
Paul shows this in paragraph 43.
"He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself."
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler.
"Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records."
When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship.
Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner.
Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
Paul is surprised about the background information.
He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.
He wants to know more about him.
I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher.
"Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner."
This also makes him want to help with his reading problems.
Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do.
Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard.
He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard.
He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.
Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul.
No school would take a runner who couldn't read.
"After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard."
Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat.
He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul.
"At first,he admires Mr.Leonard."
Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges.
Paul refers to this because he can't read either.
"All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did."
Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
"In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.'"
"Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate."
He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
He could not read.
And Paul wanted to help.
The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him.
In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.
"During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard."
The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting.
He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete.
You broke records.'
The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul.
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul.
He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track.
You broke records.
'(paragraph 38).
"He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?"
'(paragraph 40).
It shows Paul that school is important.
There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
Paul was surprised.
Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul.
"As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning."
"'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated."
During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading.
"When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him."
Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard.
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read.
But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt.
So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.
He  also realized they were similar.
I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was.
They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read.
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.
'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
"Paul helped Mr. Leonard, just like he had helped Paul."
When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him.
Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
"'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school."
'It's time to start your training.'
"After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him."
They both couldn't read.
They had something in common.
he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this.
"After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him."
Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class.
Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.
Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles.
Towards the end of the story it makes them closer.
Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in.
He is unable to read but is a good at running track.
The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something.
It's time to start your training.'
All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard.
"Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.'"
"Paul said, 'Learning center.'"
"Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.'"
"Paul said, 'Why?'"
'I can't read.'
You broke records.'
"Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.'"
"Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?'"
We had no learning center in our school.
"Paul said, 'But you went to college.'"
No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.
See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read.
They are almost alike.
Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard.
"Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge."
It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read.
but he was a really good athlete.
"He had lost his scholarship though, because he couldn't read."
So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
This guy was just like Paul.
Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early.
At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage.
Paul felt sympathic.
And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better.
Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track.
He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records.
So Paul decided to help him read.
"He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him."
"When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he doesn't get discouraged."
Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard.
Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him.
Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him.
"Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two."
The only thing he was good at was track.
He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard.
"Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track."
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a staggering effect on Paul.
Paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime.
His first actions are to inquire about his coach's former accomplishments.
"Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul."
"Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize."
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling.
Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer.
This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems.
"Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul."
In 'Gifts' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard.
Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard.
Paul then feels motivated to 'train' Mr. Leonard in reading.
The background information makes Paul puzzled.
Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.
The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul.
He knew them well.
The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class.
Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel.
So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
"Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock."
Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard's troubles.
"Like Paul, Mr. Leonard was poor in school."
Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track.
He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before.
Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.
Paul didn understand why he quiet.
but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read.
Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading.
"Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive."
He feels a reason.
He actually begins to feel adequate.
He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well.
It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder.
"So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard."
'It's time to start your training.''
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring.

Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
He broke records and got scholarships.
Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.
We had no learning centers in our school.
It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard.
So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
"Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read."
Things were different back then.
"He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college."
No college wanted someone who couldn't read.
Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul.
"All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact."
Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something.
Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.
"When Mr. Leonard explains fully however, Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding."
It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.
Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read.
Just like Paul couldn't.
"Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college."
Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle.
Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners.
It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
Paul didn't understand how he got to college.
Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
"'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school."
'It's time to start your training.'
"However, he was a good runner."
Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words.
I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul.
He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through.
Neither of them can read very well.
"In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard."
It's time to start your training.''
Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school.
The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
"Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading."
He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete.
And realizes that they are a lot a like

The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul.
Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul.
Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track.

'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'
'It's time too start you training.'

Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents.
Paul was all too familiar with the words Mr. Leonard had said.
"Mr. Leonard had flunked out of school, and lost his scholarship."
They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners.
It makes Paul think that he is not alone.

They both can't read but both are good at track.
He did not expect the man to be famous.
Niether of them could read and both good at track.
They helped eachother out.
Paul knows that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too.
He knows he's not the only person that can't read.
If you can achieve a goal you can do anything.
'It's time to start your training.'
Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.

He asked him about it.
Even though he felt embarrassed by the past.
He still answered Paul.
After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past.
He felt familiar with the feelings.
Paul felt inspired.
He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him.
"So, Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul."
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels.
He has felt the same way before and still does in school.
In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way.

"Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor."

He had a difficult time throughout high school and college.

"Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul."
Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him.

"So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed."
I think that he was determined to do better.
The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul.
He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.
Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why.
"After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read."
"Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career."
This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read.
"In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star."
This was something that Paul could relate to.
He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage.
"Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'"
"Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?'"

Paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is Mr. Leonard.
and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before.
He became more interested in Mr. Leonard's past in college.
The track coach and Paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great.
Paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased.
and he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
Suddently I realized what I could do for him.'
He felt sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because he couldn't read like him.

We had no learning centers in our school.
'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading.
He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading.

Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities.
Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul.
This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard.
Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well.
Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete.
He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read and neither can Paul.
They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them.
When Paul learns Mr. Leonard's background information he feels connected to him.
That background information about Mr. Leonard shocks Paul.
Mr. Leonard never had help with reading and he failed college.
"Pauls learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, just like him."
Paul could easily relate to Mr. Leonard.

tool bag?'
The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article.
Look up in the sky!
The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.
The author organizes the article in multiple sections.
they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk?
The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader.
iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
so white
black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside.
So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside.
White reflects more light than black.
So to me I think black would be the best color.
"Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse."
"And in """"Air Temperature"""" the average temp."
white :: White would keep the dog house cooler.
White does attract heat like the color black does.
white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse.
white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler.
"In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as."
white :: I would paint the dog house white.
The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid.
Which would cause the dog t o overheat.
While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid.
Which would help the dog stay cool.
"Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray."
black :: The doghouse will be warmer.
black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most.
so black would be the best colo r
Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature .
white :: White.
white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse.
white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat.
white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite.
This is because white doesn't attract as much heat.
Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler.
white :: the dog house will not be to hot.
in the jar the lea st
"Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse."
black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse.
There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG).
"temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp."
was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp.
in jar before starting exp.
responding:air temp.
inside jar after 10 min.
uder lamp manipulated: lid color
"In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature."
This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy.
Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors.
That is an 11(DEG) difference.
So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler.
white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat.
white ::  This color will cool down the dog house.
The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar.
black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot.
you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer.
The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool.
On hot days the dog would stay cool.
"Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45."
So its a just right roof.
if they used the white the dog house would be too cold.
the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot.
In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius.
White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day.
light gray :: Light Gray.
"Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether."
This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se.
white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors .
white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse.
black :: The black paint would absorb heat.
That would keep the doghouse warm.
white :: White is a very light color.
But with black i t attracts the sun.
"so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot."
black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer.
12 degree difference!
That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors.
black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer.
Dark colors absorb more heat energy.
In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest .
This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter.
In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
white :: white reflect the light.
So its fairly compfortable for a dog.
the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar.
this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp.
However the lid was also a bit warm.
White would be the best choice for the doghouse.
The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees.
which is super hot.
Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
white :: The paint color that they should use is white .
example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
"white :: white will, attract less heat."
black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse.
So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.
white ::  The best color for the dog house is white.
white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white.
This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better.
With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold.
white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature.
So if the roof is white the dog will too cool.
the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest.
the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
at 42 degrees celsius
-
the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer.
The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black.
Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse.
white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler.
the paint had the lowest temp.
of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
"The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside."
Light gray was in the mid dle of the data.
And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white.
The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house.
Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way.
The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do.
Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside.
Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse.
All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways.
Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse.
white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool.
white :: The color white is the best choice.
It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture.
This is proven by the data gathered by the trials.
It really depends on where t he people live and on the season.
The temperature used for explanation w as the average.
Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot.
The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black .
black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse.
This proves that black absor bs the most heat.
"Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse."
dark gray ::  I would use dark gray.
The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer.
Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG).
Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature.
white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp.
is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
white :: Darker colors usually attract more light.
"By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer."
"As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature."
white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re.
This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm.
That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
black :: Black absorbs light.
in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color.
Get it rig ht.
I sugest painting the dog house white.
The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial.
white ::  the white had the lowest temp.
"white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature."
"The darker the color, the more heat."
So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot.
So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius.
"For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius."
Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse.
and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees.
a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm.
I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
As for white is would get the least amount of heat.
black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black.
That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght.
It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold.
white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
"This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature."
"Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments."
"They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable."
So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter.
The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors.
White would not be as warm as black is.
"The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs."
I w ould paint the doghouse white.
white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside.
"This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG)."
That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
"However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed."
"If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm."
The black lid absorbed 11(DEG) more heat than the white lid.
black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy.
So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
Their hypothesis was correct.
white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white.
Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature.
"In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated."
white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse.
White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.
It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog.
white ::  white would make the dog house less hot.
As shown in the data white is the coolest.
The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog.
"However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable."
The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat.
The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest.
If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties.
If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties.
If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties.
If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties.
